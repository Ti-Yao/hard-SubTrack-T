铁齿铜牙纪晓岚I第1集
The Eloquent Ji Xiaolan series 1 episode 1 with automatically generated English subtitles.

The English subtitles were generated using OCR and google translate as such the results are not very accurate. Apologies for any strange translations.

Uploader's Note: I love this show but my Chinese is not very good so I have always wanted to produce English subtitles for it. The subtitles aren't perfect but it helps to know roughly what is going on. I basically wrote software that captures the words on the screen, tries to extract the chinese characters then puts the result through google translate
