1
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,349
Stop smoking, it smells

2
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,349
That's right, be fiercer

3
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,349
The shopkeeper will come up soon

4
00:02:24,676 --> 00:02:25,849
Be careful when they come find you to pay

5
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,849
Who is it

6
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,849
I i

7
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:32,599
shopkeeper's

8
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,990
Come in

9
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,349
The shopkeeper is right to find him

10
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,849
He threw everything away.

11
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,349
Sir, everything is here, no less, no less.

12
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,599
You didn't open this thing, did you?

13
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,599
No, no inn rules

14
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,849
we can't touch the guests' items

15
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,849
Then what do you think I do

16
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,210
You, must be a business owner

17
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,349
Yes, I am a small business owner

18
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,099
Yes yes

19
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,349
shopowner, he broke all your stuff

20
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,599
You don't want him to pay?

21
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,599
stuff

22
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:17,849
These rotten things

23
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,349
I wanted to smash it a long time ago

24
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,099
coming, shopowner

25
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,349
Good shopowner

26
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,599
Sir, do these look good

27
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,099
Make do with it, so-so, let's use it

28
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,349
please make use

29
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,349
I'll send you some food as well later

30
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,599
I Know, I know

31
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,849
It's weird. There's something wrong with the people here.

32
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,099
The more you smash things, the nicer they are

33
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,099
How could this be? That's because you have a great presence.

34
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,349
My presence?

35
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,599
Open the door, open the door, open the door

36
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,099
Sleep like a dead pig. Open the door.

37
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,099
Who is it?

38
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,099
Sir, I am urgent to see you

39
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,349
annoying

40
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,099
Let him in

41
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,849
Brother-in-law brother-in-law

42
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,849
Lao Liu, you are too outrageous

43
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,349
You making fuss in the middle of the night, why?

44
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,349
Did your sister ask you to catch us?

45
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,099
It's not a big deal, I dare not

46
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,099
I wouldn't bother brother-in-law

47
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,599
A big deal. Yancheng has a big deal?

48
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,349
There are only big crap deals here

49
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,349
Brother-in-law, look

50
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,349
Heshen

51
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,349
Sir, who cares?

52
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,526
It's late at night.

53
00:05:19,593 --> 00:05:21,466
Go, go. Servants!

54
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,349
master

55
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,849
Prepare the sedan chair, I'm going to the prefect's office

56
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,099
This is an official letter from He residence

57
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,349
This big print is the same

58
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,099
This print can't be fake, it must be Lord He's

59
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,349
Lord He Shen is here

60
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,349
Heshen is our protector

61
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,599
We have to be filial to him

62
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,599
Heshen is a big name but we've never seen him

63
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,099
Yeah, in the many years past

64
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,849
I haven't met with Lord Shen before.

65
00:05:57,413 --> 00:06:00,849
Servants, civil and military officials of prefectures and counties

66
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,849
Go to the inn to pick up  our guest immediately

67
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,599
wait, sir

68
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,599
My lord, if a different office

69
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,599
Picks up Lord He Shen first

70
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,599
We will lose out

71
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,099
Yes, Lord He Shen is the emperor's favourite

72
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,599
Last time Lord He went to Shandong

73
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,849
That office was a bit too slow

74
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,849
You can change the color of this hat (demoted)

75
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,099
we can't be slow with Lord HE

76
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,099
But now he is posing as a commoner

77
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,099
Why is he living in an inn as a commoner?

78
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,849
it means Lord He

79
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,099
doesn't want officer to disturb him

80
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,599
Master has a point

81
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,849
The admiral of the Nine Gates, Lord He is famous for

82
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,849
But Lord He finds him tiresome

83
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,099
As a result, he threw out to plant trees.

84
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,849
Ah, it's bad if we go and bad if we don't

85
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,849
What do we do?

86
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,599
Calm down, everyone, don't worry

87
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,599
Listen to Master's insights

88
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,599
What Master Fan said

89
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,593
it's bad if we go and bad if we don't

90
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,599
The best policy

91
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,099
Send someone to get details

92
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,849
Exploring situation

93
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,849
It's decided, you go for a while first

94
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,099
I

95
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,599
Master Fan, I will accompany you

96
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:45,099
one military and the other civil, then I can relax

97
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,349
Royal Lord, eat more

98
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,349
I'm going spend my life in Yunzhou

99
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,599
and you're afraid I won't eat enough of this

100
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:05,849
Royal Lord, in my opinion, only if Qianlong

101
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,349
someone's coming

102
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,226
Lord He

103
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,153
Heshen greets the Royal Lord

104
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,599
You're welcome with Lord He

105
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,599
Thank you Lord

106
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,099
Lord He, please have tea

107
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,599
Thank you

108
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,849
Ah, how can tea be for the Royal Lord?

109
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,599
Come, come, I have a good Longjing here

110
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,849
Lady Four, please

111
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,349
Thank you, He Shen

112
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,099
Lady Four, wait

113
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,099
Tell me

114
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,599
Be sure to use the treasured mountain spring water

115
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,099
Its taste cannot be lost

116
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,849
ok

117
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,349
Lord He must not be here for tea

118
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,099
Why not get straight to the point

119
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,599
Royal Lord is really fast and quick to speak. that's unique

120
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,349
He Shen came here for an antique this time

121
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,099
antique

122
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,349
Royal Lord, please take a look at this antique piece of unknown origin

123
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,849
I need to consult Royal Lord

124
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,099
With Lord Shen, this

125
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,349
This half of the golden lock is related to the life of the emperor

126
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,099
Lord, I want to ask a question

127
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,099
The emperor, is he Han chinese?

128
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,849
The emperor is the biological child of the Emperor Yongzheng.

129
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,599
How can there be doubt about it?

130
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,349
But there is a lot of inner doubt

131
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,849
The emperor is inevitably be shaken.

132
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,099
I am the emperor's biological uncle

133
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,599
How can I not know

134
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,099
the Royal Lord is the prince of the Qing Dynasty

135
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,099
But this came from nanny's own mouth

136
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,599
The emperor has to believe it

137
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,599
This is out of nothing

138
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,349
How could this nanny say that?

139
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,099
It's a strange thing

140
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,599
It's because of this matter that the emperor

141
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,849
is posing as a commoner in Yancheng

142
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:43,099
If something were to happen, the great Qing Dynasty will be in turmoil?

143
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,599
Lord He Shen failed to stop the emperor going to Yancheng

144
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,849
you have failed

145
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,599
The prince blame is fair

146
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,349
But the emperor is even filial

147
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,099
to the ends of the earth

148
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,349
He has to find his birth mother

149
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,849
How can we stop him

150
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,099
Since it coudn't be stopped in advance

151
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,186
we can stop him now

152
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,849
If he can't find his birth mother, the emperor won't come back.

153
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,099
What is the priority between public and private?

154
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,099
What Lord said is fair

155
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,099
How can Mr He not understand this truth?

156
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,349
But the emperor himself has to be convinced

157
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:23,099
that he is Yongzheng's true son

158
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:23,849
then he will come back

159
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,849
I'm afraid he won't believe anyone now

160
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,363
Emperor won't believe us

161
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,349
But if the Royal Lord says it, the emperor will believe it.

162
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:37,849
I

163
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,849
Of course, the Royal Lord is the emperor's uncle

164
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,099
The emperor's life, the Royal Lord knows well

165
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,349
But the emperor has a decree. I can't leave

166
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,849
What is this

167
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,349
Holy decree, the emperor also has a decree

168
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,599
Don't let He Shen leave Yunzhou half a step

169
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:10,316
Royal Lord, if you go to Yancheng

170
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,599
He Shen will accompany you

171
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,599
Royal Lord, resist the decree, and I will accompany you to resist the decree

172
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,849
If the emperor cuts off the Royal Lord's head

173
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,099
My head will go too

174
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:26,849
Fate of the nation, everyone is responsible

175
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,599
Including the dignified Royal Lord

176
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,099
but

177
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,599
What is the priority between public and private?

178
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,349
Royal Lord, why don't you go with Lord He

179
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,599
Lady Four, this is men's business

180
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,849
Yes a man's business, Lord

181
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,349
Lord He

182
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,349
The emperor is in the safety of the world

183
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,099
The words of the Royal Lord are the emperor's peace

184
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,849
Don't behave like this in public

185
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,599
My lord, please get up

186
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,349
No I am kneeling for people

187
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,099
Lord

188
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,099
If something happens to the emperor, life will be lost.

189
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,849
The people of the world will suffer

190
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:12,349
Royal Lord, Lord He begs you on behalf of the people

191
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,849
Lord, please

192
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,599
I promise you

193
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:28,349
He Shen, on behalf of the people, thanks you Royal Lord

194
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,493
arrow shot well

195
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,939
Lady Four, let's compete

196
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,599
Lady, your arrow technique

197
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,099
It's really eye-catching

198
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,849
Brother Fu has high praise

199
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,349
I cannot be better than than your legendary swordsmanship?

200
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,099
Lady, don't go

201
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,599
Don't go to Yancheng

202
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,099
I know you are going to assassinate the emperor

203
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,733
Lady Four, promise me, stay in Yunzhou

204
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,099
Lord Fu, I can't leave the Fourteenth Lord

205
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,099
Lady Four, you can't leave me

206
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,099
Fourteenth Lord and Lord He are waiting

207
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,349
Lady Four, you can't go

208
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,849
Why, are you afraid I will die there

209
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,349
I'm afraid

210
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:43,099
I would not be me if I was afraid of death

211
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,599
Lady Four it's a traP

212
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,599
What trap?

213
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,170
You will die if you go to Yancheng

214
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,599
You mean this is Lord He's trap

215
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,599
Lady Four, you can't go

216
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,849
I will also not let you inform the fourteenth Royal Lord

217
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,599
Lady Four, Lady Four

218
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,599
finding his mother, is causing even Mount Hua to split apart

219
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,099
Xuxian, look at them

220
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,349
Xiaoyue, think before you speak

221
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,099
ok?

222
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,849
Xu Xian is worried that he can't find his mother

223
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,573
I forgot

224
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,873
Xu Xian, don't worry

225
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,849
it's just not having a mother?

226
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,349
You see, I don't even have a father

227
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,349
Xiaoyue

228
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,099
What I said is true

229
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,849
Mr Ji, your painting

230
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,849
I knew I can't hide the truth from you

231
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,349
I painted that picture myself

232
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,099
You know you can't hide it from me

233
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,099
Hasty forgery, unable to make it look aged

234
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,349
nothing like an ancient family heirloom

235
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,599
You always love to learn from Wu Dao

236
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,349
Can't hide it from the pen

237
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,599
This old Wu hurts me

238
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,099
Xu Xian, you're sneaky

239
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,893
You know the painting is fake

240
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,349
You don't make any fuss

241
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,099
I've been worried about it the whole time

242
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,099
Xiaoyue, what are you afraid of?

243
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,849
I'm afraid you want me to bring you my Master

244
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,099
Where can I find one for you?

245
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,349
It's weird, you know it's fake

246
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,349
Why do you want come with us to Yancheng?

247
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,849
Mr Ji painstakingly forged the antique

248
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,849
just to lure me to Yancheng

249
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,849
so I fulfilled his wish

250
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,849
I'm curious about it myself

251
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,349
curious

252
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,849
I wanted to see why Ji Xiaolan led me to the Yancheng

253
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,099
What exactly does he want?

254
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,099
You really look like a kid who can't grow up

255
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,349
Xiaoyue

256
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,849
Ah what's wrong

257
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,599
Although it's fake, this golden lock is real.

258
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,849
It's a nanny's object

259
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,599
Although the nanny is from Yunzhou

260
00:17:43,783 --> 00:17:46,599
But her husband, Zheng Laoquan, is from Yancheng

261
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,349
And I also checked

262
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,099
This Zheng Laoquan is exactly a goldsmith

263
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,349
I have Zheng Laoquan's address here, take a look

264
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,099
Mochou go

265
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,099
Xu Xian, Xu Xian, you are so outrageous.

266
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,599
I just ordered food

267
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,099
You have to pay the bill if you want to leave.

268
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:10,849
Xiaoyue

269
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:11,849
Isn't Heshen here with you?

270
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,599
you don't need to pay the bill

271
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,599
people will rush to pay for him

272
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,849
Where are you going

273
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,849
Why are you pulling me

274
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,349
Let me tell you something, sit down

275
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,599
Do you know who this Xu Xian is?

276
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,349
Of course I know

277
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,099
Oh you know

278
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:37,599
Correct

279
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,349
Then he is

280
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,849
he is obviously the emperor

281
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,349
What's wrong?

282
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,599
too old

283
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,349
Why are you making such a fuss?

284
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,599
why are you making such a fuss?

285
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,599
There are errands around

286
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,099
Lord He, Lady Four is still not back

287
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,599
I'm a little worried

288
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,849
Royal Lord doesn't have to be, Yancheng is the place where she would get in trouble

289
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,349
The girl is prejudiced against the emperor

290
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,349
Maybe it's a good thing she's not coming

291
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,099
What  does Lord He think I want

292
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,599
Lord He

293
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,599
The Governor of Liangjiang has expedited documents

294
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,099
he reports floods

295
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,349
Royal Lord, this disaster relief is needed to save people.

296
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,349
Then I'll go to Yancheng first

297
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,599
Lord He is needed here to handle these duties

298
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,849
Then I will have to trouble you Royal Lord

299
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,849
Lord He, don't worry, I will go immediately.

300
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,099
Okay, then I will leave

301
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:42,849
Ok please

302
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,849
Lady Four

303
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,849
Doctor, my arrow really hit the target

304
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,849
Lord's legendary archery skills. Hit right in the shoulder

305
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,349
She'll be fine

306
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,349
But she has been in a coma for two days

307
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,349
what's going on?

308
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,099
Maybe she is in shock

309
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:24,849
Yeah, she didn't expect me to do it to her.

310
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,599
Wait I will prescribe her two medicines

311
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,849
heart medicine, we'll see if it works

312
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,349
As long as the doctor can cure her

313
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,349
No medicine is too expensive medicine

314
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,349
Yes

315
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:01,849
Lady Four

316
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,993
I pretended to be in a coma for two days and managed to trick you

317
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,599
Fu Kangan, you don't look like you've been through a lot of battles.

318
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,349
As long as you are okay

319
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,349
go

320
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,849
Lady, where are you going

321
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,349
I'm going to save the Fourteenth Lord

322
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:21,349
you

323
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,099
Ordered to issue 900,000 silver in the internal treasury

324
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,599
Hand it over to the top ministers

325
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,849
Distribution of eight and three flags

326
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:54,349
Make subordinate officials' operation generate interest

327
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,349
After you finished writing, use the official seal

328
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,599
Yes

329
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,099
That Ji Xiaolan

330
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,099
Leading the emperor to Yancheng

331
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,599
What kind of snake oil is he selling?

332
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,849
Send it back on the horse immediately

333
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,099
Sir

334
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:42,099
Why is there a problem over such a trivial matter?

335
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,349
My lord, look at this seal

336
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,099
My lord, look, look

337
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:47,349
seal

338
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:48,849
Ah, this seal

339
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:49,849
What's wrong with the seal

340
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:50,849
It's printed on

341
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,599
No, this is Ji Xiaolan's seal.

342
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,599
what

343
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,849
Is this seal real?

344
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,099
Who looks after the seal?

345
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,816
Me

346
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,599
How come this has happened

347
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,849
the emperor a few days ago

348
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,349
Before the emperor went to Yancheng

349
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,599
asked you to bring him the seal

350
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,349
Said it was to appreciate and appreciate

351
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,599
Do you know about this, my lord?

352
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:35,599
Yes, yes, I know, I know, I remember

353
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,349
The emperor sent someone

354
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,099
wanted to take my seal and play with it

355
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,849
have we not used it since?

356
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,486
No, after the emperor looked at it

357
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,426
I didn't look at it and put it away

358
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,599
Emperor

359
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,849
My lord, maybe the emperor made a mistake?

360
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,099
What mistake

361
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,099
The emperor put Ji Xiaolan's seal

362
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,599
in your seal box by mistake

363
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,599
No, how could the emperor make such a mistake?

364
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,349
What happened?

365
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,849
This is the great seal of a member of the imperial court.

366
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,099
How many important orders in the court are approved by me

367
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,849
Payment for forage and disaster relief from the Western Expedition

368
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,849
I use this seal all the time

369
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,599
How can the emperor mistake it

370
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:35,349
Besides, this kind of official seal is the same as any other

371
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,599
What is there to appreciate about it?

372
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,599
Could it be that the emperor intended to change them

373
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,349
My lord, what's the matter?

374
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,599
Ji Xiaolan's seal is with me

375
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,599
Mine is with him. He is now in Yancheng.

376
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,349
And the officials of Yancheng

377
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,349
Haven't even met me

378
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,349
My lord, Ji Xiaolan is pretending to be you.

379
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,349
good move

380
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:35,099
Notify Fu Kangan people to go to Yancheng as soon as possible

381
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,349
Yes

382
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,446
My lord, this is the inn

383
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,599
Sir, are you asleep?

384
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,463
What's wrong, sir?

385
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,849
I don't know how

386
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,099
as soon as I think about meeting Lord He

387
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,599
I have cramps in my legs and belly.

388
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,849
Bopin, you go in and have a look at Lord He

389
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:53,349
Let me stay outside and catch my breath

390
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,349
I haven't found Lord He

391
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,849
A thorn in the eye is delivered to the door

392
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,599
Guard all the doors

393
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,599
Look at my gestures and hit hard

394
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,349
Yes

395
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:12,849
What are you doing

396
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,099
one cannot avoid one's enemies

397
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:21,099
The mountains don't turn around, the water doesn't turn around, the roads don't turn around.

398
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,349
The road does not turn around

399
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,849
Do you know what place this is?

400
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,849
Oh, I don't know, sir, why don't you tell me?

401
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,849
I tell you this inn

402
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,849
It was opened by our county uncle and brother-in-law.

403
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,099
Oh, this is interesting

404
00:27:43,596 --> 00:27:45,849
Brother-in-law, hello

405
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:51,849
Did you know that this is called?

406
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,099
what is it?

407
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,766
You mean provoking the lion

408
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,849
I'm in a good mood today

409
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,349
Let you off once

410
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,099
What are you doing

411
00:28:05,526 --> 00:28:07,099
I'm comfortable sitting here

412
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,849
I feel very comfortable all over

413
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,349
Be careful I don't attack without mercy

414
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,349
Uncle Zhu, come here

415
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,099
Didn't you see I'm on official business?

416
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,099
Stop and no one can leave

417
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,099
Oh, I said sir

418
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,849
Your official position is eighth rank

419
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,849
But you have the presence of a top rank

420
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:35,099
You crawl under all the tables here for me

421
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,349
Or I won't spare you

422
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,849
Ah, sir, crawling under tables, must be fun

423
00:28:43,646 --> 00:28:46,349
This Yancheng is a simple place, and official style is interesting.

424
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,860
friendliness is conducive to business success. don't lecture me

425
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:56,849
I won't talk about peace today.

426
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:57,849
Go crawl for me quickly

427
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,849
Only dogs crawl under tables

428
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,349
Don't worry, I'll let him

429
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,349
I won't let you crawl, how can I be willing to you?

430
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,849
Are you sick? Are you tearing up the calligraphy and painting?

431
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:25,849
Heshen, Lord Heshen

432
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,349
This tea tastes better now

433
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,099
Don't go

434
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,849
Didn't you just say I should drink with you?

435
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,849
I

436
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,849
You forgot, something about a lion?

437
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,849
provoking the lion

438
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:58,099
Remember, there is another saying there's always a way out.

439
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:01,349
Oh, by the way, I'll crawl under the tables first

440
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,349
Lord

441
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:11,099
Lord He, don't be angry, I'll crawl I'll crawl

442
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,599
My lord, my lord, bad news

443
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,599
Master Zhu made a big mess

444
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,849
What, don't scare me

445
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,099
It's true that Master Zhu made Lord He angry

446
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,099
he's being punished now

447
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:38,849
Lord He

448
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,849
My lord, go in help

449
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,130
let's go, go

450
00:30:43,183 --> 00:30:43,703
Lord you can't leave

451
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,849
I'm not leaving, I can't afford it, I can hide

452
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,099
Go, go, go

453
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,023
Sir

454
00:30:55,717 --> 00:30:56,410
Sir

455
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,099
This way this way

456
00:31:23,946 --> 00:31:24,849
Emperor, I'll go to knock on the door

457
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,849
Mochou i'm afraid

458
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,099
The emperor is afraid

459
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,349
I'm afraid to see her

460
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,099
Who is she

461
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,599
the white lady, my birth mother

462
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,349
You dress as a commoner, travel a thousand miles

463
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,100
just to look for her

464
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,349
I'm afraid i'm afraid she's a Han chinese

465
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:53,349
No, I'm afraid I have Han blood

466
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,849
it doesn't matter what blood you have

467
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,849
It's all passed down to you by your mother

468
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,599
Han blood, Manchu blood

469
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,349
it's all red

470
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,849
But I am the emperor

471
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,099
Emperor and Commoner

472
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,849
we are all a child born to a mother

473
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,349
who doesn't accept their own birth mother

474
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,349
Go ahead, the white lady, she is waiting for you

475
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,349
emperor

476
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,599
Mochou Mochou

477
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,170
Emperor

478
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:06,099
It seems no one lives here

479
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,849
Excuse me, is this the Zheng family

480
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:09,397
yes Zheng family

481
00:33:10,237 --> 00:33:11,050
where are they

482
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,349
Dead, all dead

483
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,599
Emperor

484
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,099
Who are you guys

485
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:58,849
Welcomes fourteenth Lord

486
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,349
Who told you to come? Get out of the way right away.

487
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,599
Fourteenth Lord, you have no other choice

488
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,599
Fourteen Royal Lord, you don't have a choice

489
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,349
Come with us

490
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:27,599
Palace officials are here. Who dares to be presumptuous?

491
00:34:29,043 --> 00:34:32,849
don't bother, they won't come back

492
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,780
who were they?

493
00:34:34,307 --> 00:34:35,500
I don't know either

494
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,849
Lady, are you okay?

495
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:40,349
I'm fine

496
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,599
I clearly hit your acupuncture points

497
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,099
sealed your meridians, how did you

498
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,849
I practice the tendon sutra

499
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,599
No one can hit my acupuncture points

500
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,349
Then you still pretended to be subjected to me

501
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,849
You could clealy fight back

502
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,270
But you pretended you couldn't move

503
00:35:00,163 --> 00:35:01,599
I wanted to come to Yancheng with you

504
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,849
Lady Four, I'm worried about you

505
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,349
Fourteen Royal Lord has become a scapegoat

506
00:35:08,943 --> 00:35:10,349
let him fall into the trap

507
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,099
You know this trap, you can save him

508
00:35:15,316 --> 00:35:18,099
Lady Four, that's Lord He's trap

509
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,849
No one can save the Fourteenth Lord

510
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,070
can't save him then I'll die with him

511
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:24,849
Lady

512
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,349
Tell me how you contacted them

513
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,099
You say it quickly, say it quickly

514
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,849
listen

515
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,349
This is the signal

516
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,849
Who is the leader?

517
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,849
We are the Heaven and Earth Meeting against the Qing Dynasty and the restoration of the Ming Dynasty

518
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,349
Heaven and Earth Meeting

519
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,849
We know Qianlong is in Yancheng

520
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,599
Fourteen Royal Lord must be here to assassinate him

521
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,099
You know my whereabouts

522
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,599
Heaven and Earth will be willing to help the prince

523
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,599
No no

524
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:50,349
Fourteen Royal Lord was exiled by Yongzheng for how many years

525
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,599
This revenge should go to Yongzheng's son

526
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,099
take revenge

527
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,599
Your group of chaotic ministers

528
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,099
Fourteenth Lord

529
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,349
Our heaven and earth will take the anti-Qing Dynasty and the restoration of the Ming Dynasty as our mission

530
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,026
get rid of the Manchu in charge

531
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,099
But I have a common enemy with you

532
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,349
Our common enemy Qianlong

533
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:23,849
Qianlong is my nephew

534
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,599
Fourteen Royal Lord, the country is meant to be yours

535
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,349
Qianlong is posing as a commoner, in a weak position

536
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,849
Heaven and Earth will be willing to help Royal Lord remove him

537
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,349
afterwards the fourteenth Royal Lord will be emperor

538
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,349
You found the wrong person, I won't do it

539
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,099
Royal Lord it is now or never again

540
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,849
You will never have a chance to turn around

541
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,849
Farewell

542
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,849
Don't move

543
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:06,649
The Royal Lord has come now, but we can't let you leave

544
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:23,170
Mr. Ji, look, more gifts

545
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:26,196
I told you before, with me

546
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,099
there's food drink no problem

547
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,599
Strange you haven't even left

548
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,099
No one has come either

549
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,000
Why would people give you a gift?

550
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,349
You just don't understand this official business

551
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:41,099
If you want accurate information, to be well-informed

552
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,099
If you want to bow in time, you have to give gifts to not fall behind.

553
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:48,099
I heard people give gifts to officials.

554
00:38:48,353 --> 00:38:50,849
Never heard of officials giving gifts to the people

555
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,849
you can buy the wrong thing

556
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,599
But you can;t give a gift wrong

557
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,099
When I was in Yunzhou

558
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,793
there was an official who was also dismissed

559
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,599
everyone ignored him

560
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:07,349
He picks up the junk on the street alone

561
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,849
This is also officialdom

562
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,099
Whether an official is corrupt or not?

563
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,453
we can only tell after he leaves

564
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,599
You just said that the garbage collector

565
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,349
Needless to say, not corrupt

566
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,349
Then Mr Ji

567
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:27,099
I think you must be corrupt

568
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,849
Why do you say that

569
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,849
Look at you, you are not an official now

570
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,599
yet there are so many people to send you gifts

571
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,349
Then if you become an official one day in the future,

572
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,599
Then you still have to rise three feet to the ground.

573
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,003
true, true

574
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,849
By the way, Xiaoyue

575
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,026
what do you think of my calligraphy

576
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:49,599
What does it say?

577
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,349
I forgot you can't read

578
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,849
this is handwriting I copied from Heshen

579
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,599
I think there is excellent likeness

580
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,349
not learning from a good person

581
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,446
why are you learning that bastard's handwriting

582
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,099
Chongsuo, I'm in Jingyou

583
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,849
You forget I am Heshen now

584
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,599
I have to write his words

585
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,849
that's right, your words do look alike

586
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,599
I don't just learn to write like him

587
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,349
If you remember in the fish warehouse, I can learn to speak like him

588
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,849
Fish, fish, big fish Fat Head

589
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,099
Sir and Lady it's time to eat

590
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,099
eating again?

591
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,849
waiter, bring two bowls of noodles

592
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,849
our shopkeeper

593
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,099
prepared a table and banquet are specially for the master

594
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,599
people inviting for food again

595
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:38,349
Madam, why don't you eat for nothing?

596
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,599
We can't refute the boss's kindness

597
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,599
lead the way

598
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,099
Oh, I'm so full

599
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,730
People are so kind, we can't not go

600
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:49,849
Walk, walk, walk

601
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,349
I don't think it's good to be an official, prone to gain weight.

602
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,599
Sir, lady here

603
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,099
Sir, do you have Lord He's old letters

604
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,349
here

605
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,599
Master, look at this writing

606
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,349
exactly the same

607
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,613
Yes, one person wrote both

608
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,849
Lord He

609
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,099
It's really Lord He Shen

610
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,099
I thought as soon as I saw him

611
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:07,599
rich and powerful official, can't be wrong

612
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,040
How do we both eat so much?

613
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,599
Don't worry

614
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,340
Someone will come to accompany us to eat soon

615
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,599
How do you know

616
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:24,599
someone's really coming

617
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,849
Liu Changfu, Prefect of Yancheng

618
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,220
Subordinates bow before see you and your wife

619
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,099
All four of you, get up, get up

620
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:44,349
No need to be polite

621
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:45,849
Thanks Lord

622
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,849
Come, come, take a seat, please enter

623
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,260
I'm here on a mission by the Emperor

624
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,233
Pretending to be a commoner, you cannot expose my identity to people

625
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,599
Yes yes

626
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,599
The banquet at this table is sumptuous

627
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,906
Lord deserves the food to make up for their hard work.

628
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,099
Yeah, of course

629
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,099
pretending to be a commoner

630
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,849
It's hard to eat, hard to sleep, it's really difficult

631
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,586
Madam, try this

632
00:43:26,611 --> 00:43:27,849
Your chopsticks are dirty

633
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,849
How rude of me

634
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,040
I don't know if the emperor ordered my lord to make a private visit

635
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,349
How expensive is it?

636
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,099
My lord is the secret of the emperor

637
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,099
it is absurd ask

638
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,599
yes, my fault

639
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,273
You all, every year send me numerous gifts

640
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,849
Although we never met

641
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:04,819
But I count it in my heart

642
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,099
considering none of us are outsiders

643
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,349
It's good to have something to tell you.

644
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:16,736
The emperor ordered me to investigate Huang Keming's case this time.

645
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,849
I say you guys were too careless

646
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:25,849
How do you let this Huang Keming

647
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,349
go to Yunzhou

648
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,099
Sir, please relax

649
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:33,170
Then Huang Keming, he's a careless yob

650
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,849
Nonsense, Huang Keming is good man
