1
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,599
Sirs, your tea is here

2
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,849
This tea is very good

3
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,349
How are you, Uncle Fourteen?

4
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,693
buy hot buns

5
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,200
Buns

6
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,349
I warn you if you try to run

7
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,099
I'll not be so kind to you

8
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,099
What's this, wonton?

9
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,599
Madam what are you selling?

10
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,349
Wontons I have to eat bowls of wontons

11
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,349
Xiaoyue, please sit with me, I'll pay

12
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,349
I'm not eating, you hurry up

13
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,349
If my sister knew that I took you out, she would scold me to death

14
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,849
It's  because you bring me to such a good place

15
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,099
that I'll repay you after I'm full

16
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,599
by immediately write down the ledger for you

17
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,599
Really, then you eat more

18
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,099
The lady boss add another bowl

19
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,849
Don't don't don't, what place is this?

20
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,849
Lord Heshen, this Lord Fourteen

21
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,099
How can I bring my master here for dinner?

22
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,099
Relax, the master won't eat here

23
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,349
Well, let's have a late night supper here

24
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,849
Master here, the dragons and snakes are mixed and the safety is worrying.

25
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,349
Heshen, you and Kang An...

26
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,849
I'm still

27
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,849
I want to talk to Uncle Fourteen

28
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,099
what do we do?

29
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,349
Uncle Fourteen has been in Yunzhou for many years, you pick the food

30
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,849
They all know what I want to eat

31
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,599
good

32
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:34,786
the usual

33
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,099
got it

34
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,849
Why doesn't the emperor let them sit at the same table?

35
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,849
I have some family matters that I want to ask Fourteen

36
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,849
Has Uncle Fourteen ever seen this golden lock?

37
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,349
This golden lock looks familiar

38
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,349
lay it down

39
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,599
I want this golden lock

40
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,099
Leave it to the master at this time

41
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,349
Besides, with the master's skill

42
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,599
More than enough to deal with these gangsters

43
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,349
Uncle Fourteen let the man bring the wine

44
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,599
you guys have help

45
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,599
Where did this golden lock come from?

46
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,099
Nanny

47
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,349
Why are you like a starving ghost reincarnated?

48
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,849
you made me miss many meals

49
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,349
Moreover

50
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,599
The taste here is not the same in the capital

51
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,349
so i should eat more bowls

52
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,099
what?

53
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,599
Fukangan

54
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,349
don't move

55
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,849
What are you doing, Xiaoyue

56
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,599
I know what's on your mind

57
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,349
what am I thinking?

58
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,099
When you see Fu Kangan, you want to ask him for help

59
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,599
Take the opportunity to escape, right?

60
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,349
Xiaoyue, I really respect you

61
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,849
You are really a Lady Confucious, take it easy

62
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,599
As if it needed to be said

63
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,099
go!

64
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,599
thank you for the rescue, lady

65
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,099
Why do you have to be polite, please sit down

66
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,349
ok

67
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,096
Ah youth

68
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,403
flirting at first sight

69
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,349
Oh no, that fat guy is here too

70
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:17,599
he came too

71
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,599
I'm so stupid I shouldn't have told him

72
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,599
You are afraid of me running away

73
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,849
go you can't eat anymore

74
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,599
Xiaoyue

75
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,099
Let's take two more buns back

76
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,599
No, it would be troublesome for them to see

77
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,099
that's what would be stupid

78
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,849
You think we sat for a long time and they didn't see

79
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,099
As soon as we get up, they'll see

80
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,640
sit back down

81
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:37,680
Turn your face around

82
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,349
buy a flute, buy a flute

83
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,599
I buy a flute from the flute seller

84
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,349
what are you doing

85
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,349
You see this old man is still selling flutes so late

86
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,099
What a pity, buy one

87
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,599
thanks

88
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,849
Isn't this the tune of the Legend of the White Snake?

89
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,599
you can play it too

90
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,349
The nanny was seriously ill and may have been delirious

91
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,099
The emperor cannot trust her

92
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,849
Nanny's dying words shouldn't deceive me

93
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,599
This can only be opened if the locksmith is found

94
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,349
I've seen this golden lock

95
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,849
Uncle Fourteen, where?

96
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,849
I think is was...

97
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,099
Uncle Fourteen, you must think

98
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,849
It's about my life

99
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,349
How many winds and winds over the years

100
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,599
Uncle Fourteen

101
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,349
years ago

102
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,099
I have seen such golden locks in Yunzhou City

103
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,349
It seems to be in the Laojun Temple in the south of the city.

104
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,599
There is such a gold shop

105
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,599
yes must be there

106
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,349
Gold shop near Laojun Temple

107
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,599
right

108
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,099
Master, did you here?

109
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,599
This is the ancient music of Ouchi offering sacrifice to heaven

110
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,099
Who in the land of Yunzhou can play this song

111
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,849
Yes, could it be Ji Xiaolan?

112
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,849
Lord above, it's possible, I will go to see

113
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,599
good

114
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,349
This is not the legend of the White Snake

115
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,349
Is it the tune of your hometown?

116
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,599
yeah you're so smart

117
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,599
very nice

118
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,099
It's Ji Xiaolan

119
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,849
you lured him here!

120
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,099
do not move

121
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,849
I don't move, you don't either

122
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,349
Thank goodness you came

123
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,349
Otherwise I will have

124
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,599
had to deal with the two of them

125
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,099
Who told you to bring the dog officer outside, bring him here

126
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,099
go, he said he was hungry

127
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,349
How did I know he was scheming

128
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,849
lady, take me alone

129
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,599
Yeah, I'm absolutely useless

130
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,849
no use at all

131
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,599
still up

132
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,849
Huang Keming's blood debt

133
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,349
You two can't add up.

134
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,599
where to go

135
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,849
This way

136
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,349
Sister, they are all here

137
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,349
Let them go, I won't let you get away

138
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,099
Water, water, I can't swim, I really can't swim

139
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,599
Can't swim, perfect, go in!

140
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,349
Sister, he really doesn't know how to swim

141
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:09,849
we go down

142
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,349
Lord, we should not stay for a long time, go quickly

143
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,099
you see

144
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,099
We are surrounded with water, what do we do?

145
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,349
Just because we can't swim

146
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,349
They are relieved

147
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,849
to lock us up on this island

148
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,099
stop smoking

149
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,099
Can't even smoke anyway

150
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,599
The tobacco is all wet, how can I live like this

151
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,849
you two dogs

152
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,849
Weren't you escaping, I'd like to see you try

153
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,599
Xiaoyue, is this fish is for me

154
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,099
In your dreams

155
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:42,349
Such a shame, I only had one bite of that yellow fish

156
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,349
Wouldn't you say it's regretful

157
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,849
At this point in time

158
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:50,599
You're only thinking about your fish, this guy is so boring

159
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,849
I don't have tabacco to smoke, I don't have fish to eat, it's...

160
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,849
Lord Heshen, how can we get out?

161
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,099
You ask me, I want to ask you

162
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,349
Ji Xiaolan, who is also the number one scholar in the world

163
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,290
Can't think of an escape plan

164
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,849
I have been thinking this whole time

165
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,099
But she locked us in such a water island

166
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,849
Not even a sage would have a plan

167
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,099
Not really, you can ask her

168
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:30,849
ask who

169
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,099
I see that girl treats you well

170
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,599
Mr. Heshen, Xiaoyue

171
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,849
Think of a way out for us to escape, please?

172
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,099
Of course there is a way to escape

173
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,599
Just jump in the water and swim out.

174
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,099
Now it's up to you two to spend time making fish couplets

175
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,599
You have nowhere to run

176
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,349
Making fish couplets, against who? I don't have a worthy opponent

177
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,599
May I ask Mr. Ji what book references the five-color fish?

178
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,849
Notes on the Classic of Water

179
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,849
half-faced fish

180
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,980
Reference

181
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,810
Kuaji Chronicle

182
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,599
Heshen, which book references the concubine fish?

183
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,349
The fish with the elegant sword

184
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,849
Su Dongpo's Poetry and the Fish of the Team

185
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,349
Poems of Han Yu

186
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,550
No, Mr. Heshen

187
00:14:29,643 --> 00:14:30,510
How's is it wrong?

188
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,349
Young and long gatherings are different from the same team of fish

189
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,849
It's obviously Han Yu's poems from the South of the Reading City

190
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,599
I mean the three of us

191
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,599
In the fish warehouse, were making fish couplets

192
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,599
The ones you said were the most illiterate

193
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,599
It's not just vulgar, it's just crap

194
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,849
What snake oil are you selling?

195
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,099
You obviously have a wealth of knowledge in that belly

196
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,849
Mr. Ji your intellect level is league above me

197
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,349
On being a government official, you are league below

198
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,599
What does Mr. Heshen mean by this?

199
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,910
Why would I steal the limelight with the emperor present?

200
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,849
It's not like you don't know

201
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,849
The emperor is known as the First Ancient Scholar

202
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:38,599
Only fools show off intellectually in front of him

203
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,599
I'm so stupid

204
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,599
So after so many years

205
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,349
Although Mr. Ji is quite appreciated by the emperor

206
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,099
Rarely gets promoted

207
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,349
I think that's probably the reason, isn't it?

208
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,849
Mr. Ji, I always think

209
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,599
If we can join forces

210
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,349
Isn't that a grand plan?

211
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,099
What Mr. Heshen means

212
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,849
Divide the two evils and combine the two benefits

213
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,349
Hope you figure it out next time we meet

214
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,349
Next time we meet, you're leaving?

215
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:38,416
Of course, I'm going first, I'm afraid I'm  not accompany you

216
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,849
Yeah right, you're going first

217
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,099
we are stuck on this island

218
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,349
There is water all around, where are you going?

219
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,099
I know

220
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,949
No way, Mr. Heshen

221
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,900
You can swim

222
00:17:01,307 --> 00:17:02,647
Of course I can swim

223
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,099
How did Mr. Ji forget?

224
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,599
Where did He Shen get promoted from, the Imperial Guard

225
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:15,099
We fight tigers in the mountains and dragons in water

226
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,099
So when Xiaoyue pushed you into the water

227
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,349
You shouted that I can't swim, I can't swim

228
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,849
If I don't shout like that

229
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,099
Would they take us to this island?

230
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:34,849
And send only this girl to guard. Excellent

231
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,349
Lord Heshen is really brilliant

232
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,849
I'm the only one who's stupid, I really can't swim

233
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,349
Lord Heshen, then let me tag along, let's go.

234
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,099
I'm so sorry Mr. Ji

235
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,099
I really want to take you

236
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,599
let's go then

237
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,849
But the heart is not

238
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,599
Heshen's swimming power is not enough to take Mr. Ji

239
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,099
So, Mr. Ji, please be safe

240
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,349
you sit here, sit here

241
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,349
can't take me

242
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,849
No, no, no, really sit here, sit here

243
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,099
But you relax

244
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,599
I will inform the emperor as soon as possible

245
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,866
We'll send people to rescue you

246
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,349
Besides, if the two of us are together

247
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,599
She will see no one here

248
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,099
think about it

249
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,599
I'm sure Mr. Ji will realise the importance of the overall situation

250
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,743
let's go

251
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:41,849
tell the emperor

252
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,349
pyrene

253
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,099
I written Huang Keming's ledger in my heart

254
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,849
They won't be able to kill me for a while

255
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,849
you mean

256
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,599
you mean you have memorized all of Huang Keming's ledger

257
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,099
Yes, go then

258
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,849
Mr. Ji has a good memory

259
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:57,599
move

260
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,349
Okay, I'm going

261
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,099
I'm so stupid

262
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,599


263
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,099
Lord, why did you save Qianlong instead?

264
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,349
I can't not help

265
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,599
This kind of thought, you will regret for life

266
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,599
He is my relative

267
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,849
How could I endure watching him die

268
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,349
Did Yongzheng treat you as a relative

269
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,349
Qianlong is my nephew, I held him when he was a child

270
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,849
Lord, there is a lot of importance on the half piece of golden lock

271
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,599
great importance

272
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,849
As long as Qianlong is a Han person

273
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,599
He is not qualified to be the Emperor

274
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,099
But there are many rumors about this, but there is no evidence

275
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,599
The proof is is your hands

276
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,599
in my hands

277
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:10,599
You are his uncle, what you say is proof

278
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,599
But we don't know anything

279
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,599
When Yongzheng died, you  became his only elder

280
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,099
What you say counts

281
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,849
If you say he is a Han, then he is a Han

282
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,349
Lady Four

283
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,599
This is the fatal blow to Qianlong

284
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,099
what is this

285
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,849
This is the emblem of Lord Fourteen

286
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,099
Emblem of the Lord Fourteen

287
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,349
No wonder he wants to take the emperor to the wharf for a late night snack

288
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,849
It turns out that he had already arranged an assassin.

289
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,599
What do you think Heshen

290
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,599
Servant sees that if the Lord Fourteen wants to assassinate the emperor

291
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,599
why would he use his own people

292
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,099
Just buy a batch of outlaws to do the job

293
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,849
tattoos left on corpse

294
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,349
This would give him away

295
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,599
Heshen Aiqing is right

296
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,849
but it's obviously...

297
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,099
Fukangan, you are just too impulsive

298
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,099
In the future, I have to learn more from Lord Heshen

299
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:25,849
Yes

300
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:27,849
Wu Zui

301
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:28,849
minister here

302
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:29,849
Fourteenth Lord said

303
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,099
There is a goldsmith around Laojun Temple in the south of the city

304
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,099
i want to see

305
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,849
You go to inquire first, then quickly return

306
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,349
Lord He

307
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,349
Obviously you asked someone to tattoo the corpse

308
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,349
but you then

309
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,599
brother, listen to me

310
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,849
On the contrary, you vouched for the Fourteenth Lord

311
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,849
We can't get someone killed over a tattoo

312
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,849
Nothing in the world is so easy

313
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,599
But isn't that what you said to do?

314
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,599
How smart is the emperor

315
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,349
How could he be deceived by such obvious evidence planting

316
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,599
but that tattoo

317
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:18,349
That tattoo is like an ant gnawing a dike

318
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,349
Today one bite, tomorrow another

319
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,849
Can't stand for a long time

320
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,599
after a long time even the longest embankment will burst

321
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,099
But I still don't understand

322
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:37,099
There's one thing you must know, brother, let me ask

323
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,349
Who is our biggest belly trouble?

324
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,849
Fourteenth Lord

325
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,599
No he's just a underdog

326
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,849
But who else dares to oppose us except him

327
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,349
Ji Xiaolan

328
00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:00,099
Ji Xiaolan, just a scholar

329
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,599
you should not underestimate him

330
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,349
Take Huang Keming's ledger as an example.

331
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,849
I thought it was burnt, no more problem

332
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,849
who would have thought

333
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,099
He actually memorized the entire ledger.

334
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,849
Lord, we must not let him come back

335
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:23,099
Yeah, but with his ability

336
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,349
He'll be back, I can't stop it

337
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,849
What do we do, sir

338
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:33,599
There is a way

339
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,099
We can't stop him, we can let the emperor go first

340
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:42,849
The emperor is in a hurry to find the gold shop

341
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,800
Why would he leave

342
00:24:45,533 --> 00:24:46,787
It is just that goldsmith

343
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,599
that will be enough to make the emperor return to the capital early

344
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,349
But I still don't understand

345
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,599
Come on brother, let me tell you slowly

346
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,349
How are you guarding people

347
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,349
Even on this small island, you let people escape

348
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,849
He clearly said he can't swim, liar

349
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:13,849
Mochou

350
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,099
You really can't blame this Xiaoyue

351
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,349
Even I was deceived by that fat dog officer

352
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,349
If you see that fat dog in the future, you must be careful

353
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,099
Don't be like me, simple and honest

354
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,599
you can relax with me

355
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,599
You can also play the flute in return for leaning on you, and you are cunning enough

356
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:31,849
we already discussed it

357
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,599
I write out the ledger and you let me go

358
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,099
Why do I have to run away?

359
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,599
You haven't written the ledger yet

360
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,849
Don't blame me, I'm dizzy with hunger

361
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,099
How can I write it?

362
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,099
What he said is quite reasonable.

363
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,099
Shut up for me, we can't stay in this place long

364
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,349
Xiaoyue take him to the dock

365
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,349
With all due respect, you must not go to this dock

366
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,849
I said we go so we go

367
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:56,849
If you are more wordy, I will be punish you

368
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,349
Sister Mochou Mochou

369
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,849
what happened?

370
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,349
Officers and soldiers are searching the dock

371
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,849
So many people, that scene is horrible

372
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,576
This shredded tobacco is dry now, life is worth living

373
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,099
Ma'am, he's so smart

374
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,599
Thankfully we didn't go there

375
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,599
Once they cast the net

376
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,599
Not a single fish, shrimp, crab can escape

377
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,599
how did you know

378
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,849
Mochou

379
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,599
You locked the three of us in a fish warehouse

380
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,099
Later, they hijacked the fat man at the dock.

381
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,599
Locking us up on this island again

382
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,599
Not all officers and soldiers are stupid.

383
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,599
Sooner or later they would search the dock

384
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,349
It makes sense, the dog officer is not dumb

385
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,099
Where else can we hide people?

386
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,349
only the opera troupe

387
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,099
The troupe is not good, the government just searched it

388
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,349
Miss Mochou, they searched the troupes once

389
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,099
they would not again

390
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,349
Dog official is a smart dog

391
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,349
Xiaoyue take him away

392
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,599
go, did you hear? go

393
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,099
Lord Wu we did not find the gold shop

394
00:27:23,397 --> 00:27:25,763
There are no gold shops in this area

395
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,849
Didn't the emperor say that there is gold shop

396
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,849
There were some a few years ago but now they are closed

397
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,599
close down

398
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,599
what do we do?

399
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,349
What do you mean

400
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,599
the gold shop

401
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,849
there is a gold shop here

402
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,599
Where is the gold shop?

403
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,349
Mr. Wu, you can't see

404
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,099
Forgive me, if i cannot see

405
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,349
Isn't the gold shop right here?

406
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,599
Lord Wu, if you want to keep your rank

407
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:11,849
There must be a gold shop in this area

408
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,099
But the subordinate has been looking all day

409
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,599
it is good

410
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,816
I only give you one day

411
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:19,530
If after one day

412
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,099
there is no gold shop here

413
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,349
you go home and grow sweet potatoes

414
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:39,599
Of course, there is a gold shop, there is a gold shop Heshen

415
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,099
Your eyes are darting around, you want to run away

416
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,849
As soon as I run away, the sword in your hand won't last long

417
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,599
Good that you know

418
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:52,849
I always thought was strange

419
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,099
I'm a stranger walking around backstage

420
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,599
why has no one asked me anything

421
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,599
Everyone knows Brother Huang, who isn't helping us

422
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,849
Huang Keming is alive in people's heart

423
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,849
Xiaoyue bring me some ink

424
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,349
You wish I bring it to you

425
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,849
I have to write down Huang Keming's ledger

426
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,349
In honour of Huang Keming's spirit

427
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,849
Dog officer, you are no so bad

428
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,599
If it's not bad, then don't call the dog official

429
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,349
come come come, good dog, write quicklys

430
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:30,849
Why are you still calling me dog?

431
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:40,349
Shen Hao, the prefect of Yunzhou, sells the Chaoguan disaster food to the victims

432
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,349
100 taels of silver

433
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,849
Xiaoyue, here

434
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,349
You write and I read it, it will be faster

435
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,349
I can't write

436
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,099
Come and look

437
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,099
Look at these two words, what are they?

438
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,349
what is this

439
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,849
this is your name

440
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,849
my name is like this

441
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,599
yes, Xiaoyue

442
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,349
Xiaoyue

443
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,946
you have to learn to write your name

444
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,849
Come and let me teach you to write and sit

445
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,349
No, no, no, I hold a pen heavier than a sword

446
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,349
How can a warrior not write?

447
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,849
come come write write

448
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,099
right

449
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,763
don't press so hard

450
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,477
go down, go down and flick

451
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,849
you see

452
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,099
I'll hold the top

453
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,599
don't go against me, try to follow me

454
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:30,849
what do you thnk

455
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,099
Xiaoyue, I can write my own name

456
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,349
Yep

457
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,849
This is the place, master

458
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:50,599
Heshen, look at the signboard, this golden lock

459
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:56,349
Exactly the same, congratulations on finding it, master

460
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,849
Yes I made it

461
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,849
Do you remember the name of the person who ordered the golden lock?

462
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,849
decades ago

463
00:32:18,253 --> 00:32:21,046
I don't know if the customer's name can still be found

464
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,099
Don't worry, find it slowly

465
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:40,099
Found the one who ordered this golden lock

466
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,849
It's a young man who claims to be from the capital

467
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,849
From the Capital, what's the name

468
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:50,099
Shi Beile

469
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:54,349
Shi Beile never heard this person's name

470
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,349
Lord please see

471
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,849
This is written on the fifteenth day of the eighth month

472
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,599
Shi Beile, ordered the golden lock of longevity

473
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:05,849
I wish all the elders and wives could be together in a thousand miles

474
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:16,849
What kind of man was Shi Beile

475
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,599
Shi Beile, royal father!

476
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,849
yes lord

477
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,599
Look again at the words "Thousand Miles Together"

478
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,599
It was clearly written by the late Emperor Yongzheng

479
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,099
Yeah, it's very similar

480
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,599
This is the stuff of the ancestors

481
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:37,099
It can be seen that the master is indeed the real son of the late emperor

482
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,599
This half piece of golden lock is iron proof

483
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,349
Congratulations, you are a real banner man

484
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,849
Dragon Blood Dragon Vein of Destiny

485
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,349
What do you think?

486
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,349
Not bad, some are fat and some are thin

487
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:56,599
San'er

488
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,599
coming

489
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,099
Post this sign on the stand in the garden

490
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,349
Which play are we playing tonight?

491
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,599
Wangjiang Pavilion

492
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,099
Good show, I'm famous for playing Tan Ji'er

493
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:06,849
really?

494
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:07,599
Yup

495
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,849
It's a pity that Mochou won't let you on stage

496
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,849
With the hree words, Du Xiaoyue

497
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,349
we'd sell out the theatre

498
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,099
I'll just help out backstage

499
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,849
This sign doesn't look like a great opera troupe's

500
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,349
The troupe people are like me

501
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,849
they are lucky to be able to write two words

502
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,106
Hanging out such a sign will embarrass the troupe

503
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,599
Xiaoyue, this big brother can write

504
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,599
Can you

505
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,099
Of course, for the big opera troupe in the Capital

506
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,349
I write everything, whether it's Jin Liansheng...

507
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,849
He Shenchun Pavilion Celebration Class. All written by me

508
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,800
Then you also help us write one

509
00:34:45,606 --> 00:34:48,293
I can't write now I'm a prisoner

510
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,849
Knowing that you are prisoner, you should cooperate, are you going to write it?

511
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,849
Well, I write, I write, you see, I write

512
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,099
Xiaoyue, female warrior

513
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,599
The dog officer is afraid of fighting. Only my fists can persuade him

514
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,349
Master, it's time we go back to the capital

515
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,849
The origin of the golden lock has been identified

516
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,349
The identity of the master is clear

517
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,349
No need to stay in Yunzhou anymore

518
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,599
But Ji Xiaolan was not yet rescued

519
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,849
I am uneasy

520
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,099
Lord, don't worry

521
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,599
I will definitely rescue Ji Xiaolan

522
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:38,849
Yunzhou is not a safe place and you cannot stay for a long time

523
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,349
Yeah and the Fourteenth Lord

524
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,849
is also suspicious

525
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,099
The emperor should return to Capital early

526
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,849
You two are singing the same tune together

527
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,349
Intentionally not letting me stay in Yunzhou

528
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,849
Not at all

529
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,349
Master leads the country

530
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,349
China's big affairs are all waiting for you to handle

531
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,349
Each day the master stays, the world is uneasy

532
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,349
Fukangan, you dare to contradict me

533
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,099
Do you want to be like Nian Genyao (traitor)?

534
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,849
Lord, please calm down, please calm down

535
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,349
Fukang An is loyal and commendable

536
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,849
How could he be Nian Genyao?

537
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,849
After all, Master is not Emperor Yongzheng

538
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,849
I ask the master to forgive his rudeness

539
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,599
Nian Genyao

540
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,349
you go down

541
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,599
Get in the car, you two

542
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,099
master

543
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,349
Get in the car

544
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,403
You two are not allowed to peep, if you do you'll be punished

545
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,849
Eunuch Wang, last time you said that the emperor was driving in the street

546
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,849
Everyone thinks you're a laughing stock

547
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,349
what i said is true

548
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,849
The emperor, it really is the emperor, you see

549
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,349
where is where

550
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,349
on the horse carriage

551
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,599
is his emperor

552
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:05,849
It's the driver again

553
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,599
That's right, the emperor

554
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,349
You think the emperor is so bored with nothing to do

555
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:13,099
that comes here every day to drive a horse carriage

556
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,099
I'm telling the truth

557
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,349
girl, we have a problem

558
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:26,599
Are we not playing the Wangjiang Pavilion?

559
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,849
How can it be changed to Legend of the White Snake?

560
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,599
you wrote the white snake

561
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,599
You see, I keep thinking about eating snakes

562
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,599
I just accidentally wrote the legend of the White Snake

563
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,349
Master, then change the sign

564
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:37,849
It's too late. Today, it's all the government offices.

565
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,849
Hurry up and find someone to play the white lady

566
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,099
You see, you see, this troupe leader is really good

567
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,099
Just like that they can change the play

568
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,099
Dog officer is this your trick?

569
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,349
Change the play and they will come

570
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,293
who will come who will come

571
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,160
giving you a full house

572
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,599
If you don't believe it, you must see it

573
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,099
so many people

574
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,849
So because today is full

575
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,599
Don't forget to ask the leader to treat me to eat snake

576
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,849
you wish

577
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,849
don't recognise it?

578
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:20,599
This is what you two brought me

579
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,599
Dafa Gold Shop

580
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:24,599
down

581
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:35,349
Where is the gold shop and where is the old goldsmith?

582
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,099
Where is the account book written by the emperor?

583
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,099
Is this gold shop fake?

584
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,349
servant be damned

585
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,849
Do you know how I saw the flaw?

586
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:47,599
servant does not know

587
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,599
using the account book, using the emperor

588
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,349
It was written that I hope people grow up a thousand miles together.

589
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,849
Remember the story of the late emperor killing Nian Gengyao?

590
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,360
I know a little

591
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,099
On the eve of Emperor Yongzheng killing Nianyingyao

592
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,349
he wrote these two words as a warning

593
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,099
But why did Lord Yongzheng write these two sentences?

594
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,849
For your son

595
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,849
The emperor's eyes are like torches and servant throws himself to the ground in admiration

596
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,349
Fukangan

597
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,099
You came up with this ruse didn't you?

598
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,099
Yes, this was just me

599
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,349
Nothing to do with Lord He

600
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,599
No this idea is was mine

601
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,349
how dare you?

602
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,349
How dare you deceive me

603
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,099
Your Majesty, in order to find the Golden Lock

604
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,599
Endangered the state of the government

605
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,599
servant's heart was restless

606
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,849
Emperor, if you really find out that you are Han Chinese

607
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,849
That is the biggest crisis of the Qing Dynasty

608
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:47,349
Therefore, servant set up hypotheses and perjury

609
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,599
Hoping that the emperor could return to the Capital

610
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,599
This is the blessing of the Qing Dynasty and the blessing of all the people

611
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,849
Long live the safety of the Qing Dynasty

612
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,849
Kang An can't sit idly by

613
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,099
The emperor's servant deceived you

614
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,849
It's a crime that deserves death

615
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,599
Servant is willing to accompany Lord Heshen to death

616
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,849
Break the corpse into pieces without complaint

617
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:12,099
But please go back to the Capital quickly

618
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,599
May the blood of us servants wake up the emperor

619
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,099
The servants can die contently

620
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,349
emperor

621
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,599
get up, get up, get up

622
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,849
You are all loyal, how can I not understand

623
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,349
Thanks, Emperor

624
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,349
I'm restless, you two walk with me

625
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,349
Heshen will leave tomorrow morning and I will return to the Capital

626
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:56,349
Master you must be tired

627
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,599
why don't you go back sooner to reset

628
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,349
yes

629
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,099
Ji Xiaolan hasn't come back, I can't relax

630
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,349
The master doesn't have to worry

631
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:04,099
You see Ji Xiaolan's face that is blessed

632
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,349
It's sure to be a blessing in disguise

633
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,099
there's a play on

634
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,599
I met Du Xiaoyue at this theatre

635
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,599
Master, do you want to watch the show to relieve boredom?

636
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,599
not in the mood, I'm returning

637
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,849
Then servant will prepare the sedan chair

638
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,099
Today's role in The Legend of the White Snake is not bad

639
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,099
Master, they talk about the legend of the White Snake

640
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,349
Let's see who will play the white lady

641
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,099
master, this is not Du Xiaoyue

642
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:41,599
It's Hua Yanfang

643
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:43,849
look at those words

644
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:46,849
is it mispelled?

645
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,099
This is Ji Xiaolan's handwriting

646
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,099
sung really well

647
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,349
Xiaoyue let's go watch

648
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:40,349
you want to run away again

649
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,849
Look at me, just a scholar

650
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,849
How can I escape Xiaoyue warrior

651
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,349
I'm sitting here alone and bored

652
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,599
okay, okay, okay

653
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,099
You're afraid, I won't even look just listen

654
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,099
I fear you?

655
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:58,099
You're afraid I'll slip away while I'm watching the show

656
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,599
If only Mochou were here

657
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,849
People with good kung fu are not afraid of others running away

658
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,849
go and watch then

659
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,099
no I wait, if I run away

660
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,099
I feel sorry for your elder sister to scold you

661
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,099
if you run

662
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,599
then my name isn't Xiaoyue

663
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,849
go

664
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:18,413
really

665
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,599
The play is so beautiful

666
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,273
walk, walk, hurry, hurry

667
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,599
Ji Xiaolan is really here

668
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:10,849
how do you figure?

669
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,849
"Ji five six people", they got it wrong

670
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,099
It should be the "five-Ji six-language"

671
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:27,099
Ji Ju Xiaolan's is ranked fifth, called five-Ji

672
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:29,849
It's probably a coincidence

673
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,349
he's sending us a signal

674
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,349
Fukangan, get someone right away

675
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:36,599
Yes
