1
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,599
barricade the opera house

2
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,349
don't let anyone go

3
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,099
so many palace soldiers

4
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:49,210
let me see

5
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,403
There really are a lot of soldiers

6
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,599
don't move

7
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,349
what are you doing

8
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,599
you Xiaoyue

9
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,599
Xiaoyue quickly take him into the wall

10
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,349
Walk

11
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,849
No wonder you dare to hide me here

12
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,599
you were already prepared

13
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,349
less talk, go inside

14
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,349
Xiaoyue

15
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,349
go fast

16
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,599
Sister, the dog official is hidden in the wall, you can relax

17
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,349
get out of the way

18
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:29,599
Sir, we only follow the rules and sing opera

19
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,849
Sir, we didn't find Mr Ji

20
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,349
impossible

21
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,599
I can see someone smoking a big pipe inside

22
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,849
really

23
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,849
The wall is empty, someone break it down for me

24
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,849
oh everyone came

25
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,849
The lord is really amazing

26
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,849
Sure enough, it's Ji Xiaolan

27
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,849
The troupe kidnapped an imperial official, arrest them

28
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,349
misunderstanding misunderstanding

29
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,849
Why does Fu Kangan talk about kidnapping?

30
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,849
Ji Xiaolan, didn't they kidnap you?

31
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,349
no such thing

32
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,099
I'm greedy for the troupe style

33
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,599
So I lingered

34
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,599
Look, this troupe are all acquaintances

35
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,349
They're all my good friends, right?

36
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,849
Sister, the dog official says we're good friend

37
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,013
Ji Xiaolan, you were locked in the wall

38
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:06,820
How do you explain that?

39
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,849
I have anxiety

40
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,349
It's a false alarm

41
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:15,849
dog official

42
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,599
Xiaoyue we can no longer call him dog official

43
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,599
Mr Ji saved us

44
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,849
you laugh and laugh

45
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,599
what?

46
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,849
how hard we tried to find you

47
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,099
Besides, why are you protecting the kidnappers?

48
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,349
Lord He, the master is not worried why are you?

49
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,349
you listen to this

50
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,099
Mr Ji must have his reasoning

51
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,849
Lord, look here

52
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,599
Lady Four walk quickly

53
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,349
This looks like Fu Kangan's soldiers

54
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,349
must be lively

55
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,099
go fast

56
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,599
We should not stay in the wrong place for a long time

57
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,746
If you don't enter a tiger's den, you can't get a tiger's son

58
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,599
Lady Four

59
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,849
Goddess of Mercy also has a golden lock

60
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,349
Master, you are an immortal who was born to meet the destiny.

61
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,849
who owns this painting

62
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,099
Wenzhen is a man

63
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,099
Asking you a question, are you dumb?

64
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,349
Lord

65
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,599
This painting is not our troupe's

66
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,849
Mr Ji what the hell is going on?

67
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,849
This painting is hanging here

68
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,849
I don't know what's going on

69
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,099
Who's is this

70
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,599
yeah not yours

71
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,099
How to explain this painting

72
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,349
I don't know

73
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,349
Who's is this

74
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,099
please don't implicate us all

75
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,849
I am here thank you

76
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,849
Lord, don't get agitated

77
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,349
Let's take them back and interrogate them

78
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,849
We'll definitely get to the bottom of it

79
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,849
yes, take everyone back

80
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,849
My God, who bought it, who hung it up?

81
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,099
Hurry up and talk, my mother

82
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,099
Take them all back to the government office

83
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,099
Wait, Mr Ji must have an explanation, right?

84
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,849
I can probably guess who's this picture is

85
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,599
Du Xiaoyue own up to what you did

86
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:43,599
I

87
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,099
take her

88
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,599
You dog official dare to lie

89
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,849
Master, can you let me interrogate her in private?

90
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,599
you

91
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,349
Mr Ji of course

92
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,410
Thank you Master

93
00:07:59,156 --> 00:08:03,349
let's go

94
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,349
let me tell you, I painted that painting

95
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,599
dog official you want to harm us

96
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,849
Xiaoyue listen to what he has to say

97
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:10,849
I remember

98
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,363
last afternoon you were by the painting

99
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,910
painted a whole afternoon

100
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:14,599
go tell them the truth

101
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,349
Xiaoyue

102
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,599
Mr Ji wouldn't paint for no reason

103
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,599
I think you have your intentions, right?

104
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,849
yes Mochou is smart

105
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,349
I ask you whether the ledger is important or not

106
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,099
If you have the ledger, you can sue Yancheng officials.

107
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:25,849
Rescue the victims

108
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,849
Okay, then your brother Huang Keming had the ledger.

109
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,849
Why couldn't he sue the government?

110
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,440
Officials protect each other

111
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,099
to sue the government

112
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,599
Not only must there be evidence, but also a plan

113
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:34,579
what plan

114
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:36,349
The painting is the plan

115
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:37,320
painting?

116
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:38,849
Please explain

117
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,599
no time now

118
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,099
Anyway, when we go

119
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,099
Whatever I say, just say yes

120
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,849
Also be sure to remember

121
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,349
Lord Heshen, I think Ji Xiaolan has

122
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,849
a secret with them

123
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,349
You can't say this in front of your master.

124
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,349
If there is no conspiracy, why are they being sneaky?

125
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,349
Ji Xiaolan helped the master find this painting

126
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,349
A great achievement

127
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,599
your illustrious feats

128
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,349
cannot compare to his

129
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,099
Literati dogs, despicable

130
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,599
How is it, Mr Ji?

131
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,349
Du Xiaoyue, explain it yourself

132
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,599
Miss Xiaoyue's painting looks broken

133
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,849
did you buy it

134
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,099
You are right, it was given to me by my master

135
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:37,849
your master

136
00:09:38,923 --> 00:09:39,349
oh no

137
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,099
opera teacher

138
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,599
where is your master now

139
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,849
Do you want to know? You have to agree to my conditions first

140
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,599
Presumptuous

141
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,599
Say

142
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,599
First of all, don't bother this opera troupe anymore

143
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,349
I promise

144
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,099
good

145
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,349
The second is to restore the name of Huang Keming, brother Huang

146
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,099
no reason

147
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,349
I also promise this one

148
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,599
third

149
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,099
third third third

150
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,349
If there is no third, don't make random conditions

151
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:19,849
third

152
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,849
About Mr Ji

153
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,349
Of course, about our kidnapping of Mr Ji

154
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,349
you won't hold us accountable

155
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,849
If Mr Ji doesn't care, why should I pursue it

156
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,849
so refreshing

157
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,099
Are these three conditions taught by you?

158
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,349
I can't hide anything from the eyes of Lord Heshen

159
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,599
Xiaoyue, what is your master's name

160
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,096
My master's surname is Bai

161
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:45,849
white?

162
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,849
self-proclaimed the white lady

163
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,599
the white lady

164
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,849
where does she live

165
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,849
Yancheng

166
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,099
Lord, Qianlong is going to Yancheng

167
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,599
Lady Four was originally a liar

168
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,599
what

169
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,349
Qianlong was originally Yongzheng's biological son

170
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,099
Where folktale come from about his birth mother?

171
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,349
What about the golden lock and the white lady?

172
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,849
I have never heard Yongzheng talk about it

173
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,349
Royal Lord, let's go to Yancheng too

174
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:49,477
what?

175
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,099
Qianlong looks for his mother in his commoner clothes

176
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,349
There are definitely not many people with him

177
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,099
If you and I rushed to Yancheng and we can kill him

178
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,599
unknown to god or ghost

179
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,599
Lady Four

180
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,349
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

181
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:14,099
This is Lord Kangxi giving you a chance in the dark, Lord

182
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,093
I don't want to be emperor

183
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:27,652
But I want to be Queen

184
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,849
Lord Heshen, can't you stop the emperor?

185
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,349
Brother, you don't know the Lord

186
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,849
What kind of place is Yancheng

187
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,099
How can the master take risks so easily?

188
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,349
But the master is the most filial person

189
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,349
Once he learned of his birth mother

190
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,599
How can he sit still?

191
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,099
can you not dissuade the emperor

192
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,099
the position of top minister is wasted

193
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,849
Brother is right

194
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:14,349
Then tomorrow morning I will face the holy death remonstrance

195
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,349
Sir, this is absolutely impossible

196
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,599
under the right words

197
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,599
If the emperor really does not listen to the advice

198
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,849
I will kill myself on the spot

199
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,599
Sir, I will accompany you

200
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,349
good

201
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,349
There is a woman calling herself Du Xiaoyue who wants to visit

202
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,099
Du Xiaoyue, an opera singer, I don't want to see her

203
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,849
My lord Du Xiaoyue said she came to deliver a letter

204
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,099
whose letter

205
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,099
Xu Shan

206
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,599
absurd, chuck her out

207
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,349
let her, let's invite her in

208
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,099
Sir this

209
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,349
please come in please come in

210
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,099
what don't you know me anymore

211
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,599
Xiaoyue, Xu Xian's letter?

212
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:03,599
Yes

213
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,849
Did he say who it's for?

214
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,099
he said just give this letter to a fat man

215
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,849
The fat man looks like it's for me

216
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,599
How come it's for you?

217
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,099
Sir, look around, I'm the fat one

218
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,099
Is it, Wu Zhifu?

219
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,849
You can know the allusion to referring to a deer as a horse

220
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,599
Lord Fu, look at me compared to Wu Zhifu

221
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,349
who is fatter

222
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,099
Of course, Lord Heshen is fat

223
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,849
you see

224
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,599
Of course, of course, Mr. Heshen

225
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,849
You see that your heaven is full

226
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,599
Face is round and red, full of great fortune

227
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:57,849
It's okay, Wu Zui has to be a bit more subtle with flattery

228
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,599
Great fortuen can only be said to be the emperor

229
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,099
I'm just a little fatter than you

230
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,099
more than a bit fat

231
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,599
Look how thin Wu is now

232
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,099
You are smart

233
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,849
Miss Xiaoyue gave me the letter

234
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,599
it was for you

235
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,599
What does the emperor say

236
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,599
The emperor said let us three

237
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,849
Give their official seals to Xiaoyue

238
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,099
what does the emperor mean

239
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,099
He said he was going to play

240
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,599
What's so funny about the official seal?

241
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,849
I don't know at the moment

242
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,099
Master's word is what it is

243
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,599
hey hurry up

244
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,099
Xu Xian said there was stuff for me to bring back

245
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,349
Right, Xu Xian also said

246
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,349
that you will take me back in a sedan chair

247
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,849
Master Wu, then prepare the sedan chair

248
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,099
Send Xiaoyue back

249
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:25,207
they're really heavy

250
00:16:26,713 --> 00:16:28,340
come come put them here

251
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,849
Mr Ji, the official seals you wanted

252
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,349
I got them all for you

253
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,849
good seals really good seals

254
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,849
But I still don't understand

255
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,599
What do you want these official seals for?

256
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,599
With these official seals

257
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,849
I can find out what you asked me to investigate.

258
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,099
It's that simple

259
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,349
Then Mr Ji's plan

260
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,349
I have to guess

261
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,849
Xiaoyue, do you have a seal in your troupe?

262
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,099
seal, we have

263
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,599
bring one over here

264
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,349
Why didn't Lord Heshen enter to dissuade the emperor?

265
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,349
I came at dawn

266
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,349
But the emperor sent guards, no one was allowed to enter

267
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:41,849
Not even Lord Heshen

268
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,099
After how many years, this is the first time

269
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,849
It's because of Ji Xiaolan

270
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:51,599
enter

271
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,599
Lord Fu, what are you doing?

272
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,849
The emperor doesn't let us enter

273
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,849
I also don't let the emperor go to Yancheng

274
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,099
This is absolutely impossible

275
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,849
You are just crazy

276
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,099
Lord Heshen, in order to protect the emperor

277
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,849
I, Kangan will not rest until dead

278
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,375
Such strong resolve in this loyal minister

279
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,599
Today, He Shen sees you

280
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,849
Can the Emperor see us?

281
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,849
the emperor left at midnight

282
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,349
and you only just opened the door

283
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,599
You didn't mean to tease us, did you?

284
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:44,099
Don't get me wrong, two Lords

285
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,349
The emperor gave me orders

286
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,099
Only open the door at the end of the day

287
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,849
Otherwise, I would be punished with treason

288
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,599
This must be Ji Xiaolan's top idea

289
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,599
Heshen, let's chase

290
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,349
The two adults must stay in Yunzhou and cannot leave without permission

291
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,349
Walk

292
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,349
slow, stop

293
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,599
Mochou let's wait for him here

294
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,099
where are you from

295
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,599
we come from Yancheng

296
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,599
Yancheng has a large amount of food for disaster relief

297
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,099
They were all shipped from Lotau's warehouse.

298
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,099
official's are cruel

299
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,849
We get a grain

300
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,099
Mr Ji, you and Fu Kangan

301
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,599
are both big palace officials

302
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,849
All respect him

303
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,599
Who is this Xu Xian?

304
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,349
I cannot say

305
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,599
willing to brave the heat

306
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,099
to find his birth mother

307
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,349
This man must not be bad

308
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,599
well said

309
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,849
But once we get to Yancheng

310
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,349
and he doesn't find his biological mother

311
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,599
What to do when he arrives

312
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,849
After arriving at Yancheng, I'm afraid I can't help him

313
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,373
Xu Xian, don't look, you can't save them

314
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,099
Xiaoyue, make speed ​​to Yancheng

315
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,099
Mr Ji now I understand

316
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,849
Why you want to take me to Yancheng

317
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,099
hey go

318
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,099
I'm so restless, and you can calmly drink tea

319
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,849
What's the use of urgency, brother

320
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,349
I can't taste the real taste in a hurry

321
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,849
Ji Xiaolan led the emperor to Yancheng

322
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,099
Obviously not looking for the emperor's biological mother

323
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,349
But to thoroughly investigate the case of stolen grain relief.

324
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,849
OK bro

325
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,349
It seems that Ji Xiaolan's move

326
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,849
didn't get past you

327
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,849
But Ji Xiaolan took the emperor by the nose to Yancheng

328
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,599
we cannot keep a handle on the case

329
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,849
So we have to rush to Yancheng

330
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,099
to stop this

331
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,349
But the emperor has ordered

332
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,349
You and I can't move

333
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,349
I want to go to Yancheng

334
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,099
certainly

335
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,099
easy to handle

336
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,599
find him

337
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,849
News from the government office

338
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,849
Qianlong went to Yancheng in the middle of the night

339
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,849
Sir, why don't you speak

340
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,599
don't mention it again

341
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,849
Fu Kangan is already within my grasp

342
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,349
Using him, we can get to Qianlong

343
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,099
Take advantage of the opportunity

344
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,349
Lady Four I want to go back to the capital

345
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:31,849
Lord

346
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,099
I want you to go with me

347
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,849
Fourteenth Lord

348
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,849
Just lead him to Yancheng

349
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,063
we can then

350
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,349
Justifiably rush to Yancheng

351
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,849
Why would he go to Yancheng?

352
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,349
He's going to assassinate the emperor

353
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,349
And we are going to the rescue

354
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,849
But the Fourteenth Lord is now a bird in shock

355
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,849
He never dared to leave Yunzhou for half a step.

356
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,099
That time is over

357
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:25,349
Besides, you and Lady Four are courting

358
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,099
can't you impress her

359
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,043
Lady Four

360
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,849
Why do adults impound my car?

361
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,099
let me go

362
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,599
Why would you impound my car and let me go?

363
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,099
Xiaoyue, listen to me

364
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,099
You have to be calm and not impulsive

365
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,599
No matter what happens, you can't attack

366
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,349
Do you understand?

367
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,849
I get it, you said it 800 times

368
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,849
old people talk too much

369
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,349
Too much talk, Mr. Ji, let's go

370
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,849
Hey, stop those people for me

371
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:24,599
what you doing

372
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,849
Ordered to track down the anti-Qing and Fuming rebels

373
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,099
we are merchants

374
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,599
can't you tell?

375
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,099
merchents?

376
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,849
Anti-Qing Fu Ming rebels

377
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,099
are all pretending to be merchants

378
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,599
I see you look

379
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,099
Just like the anti-Qing and Fu Ming rebels

380
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,599
me, rebel?

381
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,099
I say this soldier, you have a sharp eye

382
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,099
detain them for me

383
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:56,099
you dare

384
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,349
Mr Ji, maybe they just want a bribe

385
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,196
Oh I have it

386
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,349
This man, we are really merchants

387
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,349
ah merchants

388
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,099
As soon as I see you, I think you are honest businessmen

389
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,099
Yes Yes Yes

390
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,099

00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:37,349

395
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,099
Thank you, sir, thank you

396
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,599
go, go, go, go

397
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,599
Come over, are you hiding something?

398
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,349
Is there anything good hidden in you?

399
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,349
you look pretty

400
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,349
don't let a small thing turn into a big mess

401
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,120
let's go

402
00:25:56,393 --> 00:25:57,273
It's important to find the white lady

403
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,349
search her for me

404
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,349
let me go

405
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,600
Girl, don't be afraid, I'm here

406
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:09,349
Xu Xian, nice going

407
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,849
Shame on your face, you are courting death

408
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:14,849
girl you go first

409
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,349
You are shaming the whole Qing Dynasty

410
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,349
catch this guy, attack

411
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,099
What should we do, Mr Ji?

412
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,349
What else is there to do? Attack

413
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,349
Xiaoyue take them fast

414
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,349
why are you laughing

415
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,599
I laugh so loudly the emperor of the Qing Dynasty

416
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,849
Fighting with people like a street prankster

417
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,099
i forget it happened

418
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,099
The imperial throne's purpose cannot be forgotten

419
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,849
I remember the words of good sir

420
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,849
stop, I'll see where you run to

421
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,349
what are you doing

422
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,849
Lord, you forgot your purpose again

423
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,349
I'm happy

424
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,849
I'm in trouble if you're happy

425
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,349
here, here, hurry up, here

426
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:21,849
what are you doing

427
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,599
There are bad people chasing us, help

428
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,599
Hurry, hurry in, hurry in, hurry in

429
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:29,599
go this way

430
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,849
Grab them and tear them limb from limb, search!

431
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,099
what to do

432
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,349
hide first

433
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,349
search carefully

434
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,599
get out the way

435
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,599
Your Majesty, look at this basket there are six long lines

436
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,599
This is the hexagram of Qian

437
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:09,599
Qiangua, flying dragon

438
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,599
What's the matter

439
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:36,849
what to do, sister

440
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,849
we are surrounded

441
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,849
Where did the flying dragon sign come from?

442
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,099
Strange, this sign can't be wrong.

443
00:29:50,516 --> 00:29:52,099
we're going to become pincushions

444
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,099
Your Majesty, this is obviously the hexagram of Qian

445
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,849
flying dragon in the sky

446
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:03,599
The emperor is flying dragon

447
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:03,849
Sir, you are a sage

448
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,349
I'm not a sage

449
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,099
I just read a lot

450
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,099
Your Majesty, look at the flying dragon in the sky

451
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,349
Catch the two criminals

452
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,080
Sister, the dog soldiers come up

453
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,849
Sir do you have a solution

454
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,349
Many problems, no solutions

455
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,099
They must be hiding in there and stab him at me

456
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,349
Mr Ji go

457
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,349
careful

458
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,099
Xu Xian, nice

459
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,599
The inner heroine, admirable

460
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,349
no time to admire, let's go

461
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,849
Mr Ji, please help

462
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,840
Okay, who am I here to help?

463
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,099
help her

464
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,099
I see

465
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,599
don't delay, go

466
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,599
OK

467
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,873
Xiaoyue go with them quickly

468
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,349
chase after her

469
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,099
Lord

470
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,349
to go or not to go

471
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,349
The carriage is ready

472
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:31,599
Lady Four, are you willing to go to Beijing with me?

473
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,099
Four is with the Lord for life

474
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,349
Where Lord goes I go?

475
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,099
You don't have to for a criminal

476
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,849
Ruin your great youth

477
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,849
I have no regrets

478
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,599
Lady Four I can't make you queen

479
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,599
Lord is indifferent to fame and fortune, Four admires it

480
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,849
You know me like my father Lord Kangxi knew me

481
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,849
Royal Lord

482
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:36,849
Let's go

483
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,599
I think we'll stay here

484
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,349
We also stay in the inn

485
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:58,349
I can't let you, Xu Xian, live on the high street.

486
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,349
Mr Ji

487
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,349
there are people chasing us everywhere

488
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:03,849
they will definitely come to check on this inn

489
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,349
i thought about it

490
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,349
He'll look up four single men and women

491
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:11,336
But he won't check for two married couples

492
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:13,517
Where are two married couples

493
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,099
isn't this two married couples

494
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,099
The two of them are not husband and wife

495
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,099
let's go

496
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,016
If the two of them are a couple, what about us?

497
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,057
we are also a married couple

498
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,099
you wish! I don't want to be paired with you

499
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,849
Xiaoyue, after we go in

500
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,349
pretend not to recognise them

501
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,849
definitely don't say hi to them

502
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,599
I don't want to pretend to be husband and wife

503
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,099
If I wanted to pretend, I'd pretend with Xu Xian

504
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,349
why

505
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,849
he more handsome than you

506
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,349
Walk

507
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,136
please enter

508
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,849
Are you satisfied?

509
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,099
Not bad, it will do

510
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,920
here waiter, a tip

511
00:36:14,287 --> 00:36:15,053

512
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,349

513
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,599

514
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,849

515
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,849
huh, surnamed Ji, you really eat a leopard's guts

516
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,099
I didn't eat

517
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,599
The thief is immortal and courageous again

518
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,099
Xiaoyue you are

519
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,099
don't think to take advantage of me

520
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,599
You know how good my martial arts are

521
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,099
I'll explain to you, okay?

522
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,849
There is someone here, so don't reveal it

523
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,099
someone meter

524
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,599
who

525
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,349
the waiter, bringing water

526
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,099
come in

527
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,099
Mr and Mrs, hot water

528
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,383
who is his wife

529
00:36:45,463 --> 00:36:47,036
come on wife

530
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,599
I really didn't peek at that girl just now

531
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,723
Although she is beautiful

532
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,349
But I didn't even look at her

533
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,099
waiter, find me a room, I want to move out

534
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,349
Madam, the gentleman looking at other women

535
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,849
isn't with emotions

536
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,349
don't take it too seriously

537
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,099
What did you say

538
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,599
madam i admit i did see her

539
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,599
I said a few words to her

540
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,849
I touched her hand too

541
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,599
Second, I'm not a husband at all with him.

542
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,599
it's that he rather die than lose face

543
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:12,490
I know

544
00:37:12,537 --> 00:37:13,437
what do you know?

545
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,849
Lord, messing around outside

546
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,349
Madam, you have to teach him a lesson, he deserves it

547
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,599
waiter you are really smart

548
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,099
Stupid, look at me like this

549
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,099

550
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:23,849
yes you do

551
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,349
how?

552
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,349
It's not obvious

553
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,849
It's all kindness and love that come out after cheating

554
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,849
as angry as you madam

555
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,349
Must the first wife

556
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,849
You are so smart, you said it well

557
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,099
Come on, sir, I'll give another tup

558
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:37,849
not allowed

559
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,133
madam won't let me give

560
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:41,133
she's angry

561
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,599
Sir, you can do it yourself

562
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,849
Thanks for reminding

563
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,349
stupid you piss me off

564
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,599
I just won't sleep tonight

565
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,849
I can't be here either, I'm leaving

566
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,599
madam madam can't go

567
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,099
Xiaoyue, do you want to avenge Huang Keming?

568
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,599
Do you want to help the people in the disaster area?

569
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,349
of course, even in my dreams

570
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,599
Then you have to pretend to be husband and wife with me tonight

571
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,099
who are you deceiving

572
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,599
if i guess right

573
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,849
It will be known tonight

574
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,349
tonight

575
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:13,099
right

576
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,599
Then we won't have to pretend to be husband and wife tomorrow.

577
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,599
Tomorrow you can pretend to be my mother

578
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,849
am i that old

579
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,849
Xu Xian, go to bed

580
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,849
i sit here all night

581
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,849
Mochou have you ever thought about it

582
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,599
Why does Ji Xiaolan and Xiaoyue pretend to be husband and wife?

583
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,090
but pushed you to me

584
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,423
I don't know

585
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,099
If Xiaoyue lives with me

586
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,349
In less than a night, you will be asked left and right by me

587
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:07,349
She would not be able to keep her secret

588
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,599
This was painted by Xiaoyue's Master

589
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,599
If this picture is really Xiaoyue's

590
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,099
Ji Yun would have let her stay with me

591
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,849
and let me ask her carefully

592
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,849
and inquire about her master's whereabouts

593
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,599
He pushed you to me first

594
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,099
That's more of a disguise

595
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,849
I'm starting to doubt the authenticity of this painting

596
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,099
Xu Xian

597
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,099
The painting didn't fall

598
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,153
As if the painter was afraid that others would recognize him

599
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,599
Ink is still new

600
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,349
It's lnot ike what Xiaoyue's master would leave behind

601
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,849
Ji Xiaolan painted it, right?

602
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:49,599
you

603
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,849
this is your fan

604
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,099
Mochou look at this fan

605
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,099
This is pen and ink

606
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,349
Doesn't this and the painting

607
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,099
share many similarities

608
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,849
This fan was painted by Ji Xiaolan

609
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,099
He thought because he didn't sign it, I wouldn't recognise it

610
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,849
Unexpectedly his talent showed him

611
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,849
Xu Xian, you also leaked your secret

612
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,349
I

613
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:27,099
This fan is written with minister Ji Yun

614
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,849
your Majesty your Majesty

615
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,849
Mochou I don't need to be polite for private patrols

616
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,599
You still call me Xu Xian

617
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:37,349
Emperor, no, Xu Xian

618
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,099
The people in the disaster area are looking forward to your visit

619
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,599
i came too late

620
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:55,599
Lord

621
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,099
Who would dare to leave the Fourteenth Lord here?

622
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,849
Fourteenth Lord shall not leave

623
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,599
who is so bold

624
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,599
emperor

625
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,849
The imperial decree is a greater than a mountain, asking the Fourteenth Lordto come back

626
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,099
Sir, have you seen it?

627
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,099
Qianlong has rules for you

628
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:22,099
You are still under house arrest here

629
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,349
What is the difference between this and Yongzheng?

630
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,599
Lady Four be careful

631
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,849
I'm not afraid, kill me if you dare

632
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,349
no nonsense, let's return

633
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:47,790
Fourteenth Lord?

634
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,599
Yes, I have come to Yancheng

635
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,740
There must be someone who will take advantage of the fourteenth Lord

636
00:41:53,807 --> 00:41:54,507
make trouble

637
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,599
So I have ordered that

638
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,849
It is strictly forbidden for Lord Fourteen Ren to leave the cloud

639
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,849
I'm afraid your Majesty's effort

640
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,849
the Fourteenth Lord won't appreciate

641
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,599
Whether he appreciates or not I don't care

642
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,099
Since my enthronement

643
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,599
Every policy implemented

644
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,349
Which one is has not faced

645
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:14,849
Criticism of the old ministers in the capital

646
00:42:15,063 --> 00:42:16,849
Which order has been implemented smoothly

647
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,849
I never imagined it would be so difficult to be emperor

648
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:22,849
If there is even one corrupt official in the world

649
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,349
it is the emperor's fault

650
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,349
In the world there are people suffering

651
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,099
that is the failure of the emperor

652
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:33,849
The Son of Heaven The Son of Heaven

653
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,599
how can one not be frightened and trembling with fear?

654
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,349
you are not resting

655
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,099
After I left the capital

656
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,849
have ordered them to bring all the throne's memos

657
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,349
Send it to Yunzhou with a fast horse

658
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:49,849
There must be no negligence

659
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,849
no movement at all

660
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,849
maybe they were fed up of your overacting?

661
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,849
oh, don't worry

662
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,349
hey yes

663
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:26,849
In a moment I'll throw some stuff down

664
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:29,849
you scold me loudly

665
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,349
scold, I can't

666
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,849
Oh, what's wrong with scolding people?

667
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:33,849
you scold me

668
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,599
scold you for no reason

669
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,349
I can't scold

670
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:50,099
oh, which one has no eyes

671
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:52,599
are your eyes on your behind?

672
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,349
wife, wife

673
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,599
how come you are throwing my stuff out

674
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,599
waiter, have you seen my stuff?

675
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:04,099
Yo, it's you

676
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,599
tigress at home

677
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:09,099
sorry

678
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:10,599
ouch lady wife

679
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:11,849
You can't throw this thing away

680
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,099
Madam, this thing can't be thrown away

681
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,099
Ouch, can't stay here

682
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,099
you're crazy

683
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,349
If the inn asks you to pay later

684
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:27,349
you will be screwed

685
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,349
Don't worry, they not only won't let me pay

686
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:31,099
they will send a new ones

687
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,599
wife, please have mercy

688
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,099
This can't be thrown anymore

689
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,599
Let's make it clear

690
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,849
It's none of my business, pay for it yourself

691
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:42,349
hey wife, wife

692
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,099
Oh wife, you have no mercy

693
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,099
such a large seal

694
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,349
This print is reversed. Bring a piece of paper.

695
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,349
Who's is this seal?

696
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:20,349
Minister of defence Heshen
