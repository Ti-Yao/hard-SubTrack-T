You must have forgot it somewhere

54
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,099
looking around

55
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,349
Looking for it, caught in the armpit

56
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:43,099
or hidden in the boots?

57
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,349
On the birthday of Empress Dowager Ji Xiao'lan, you should present a blank paper.

58
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,599

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,349
why do you carry it over

64
00:06:12,443 --> 00:06:13,849

65
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,599

66
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,099

I know

70
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,099

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,099

72
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,693
Many thanks, Lord Heshen, come and put it down slowly

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,883
Lord Heshen step back and then step back again

74

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:57,349

76
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,099
The queen mother, this is what I gave to you

77
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,099
This Ji Xiao'lan is opportunistic

78
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,849
Heshen hates people

79
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,849
This is borrowing flowers to offer the Buddha

80
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,849
Thank you Lord He

81
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,099
Sister, what's wrong?

00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,599
Officers coming to catch me everywhere

83
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,849
Sister, hide in the troupe to see who dares to touch you

84
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,349
Xiao'yue, help me save this stuff

85
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,599

94
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,599

95
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,099
Uncle, forgive our clumsiness, where did this come from?

96
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,349
Yeah, how did Haotian Palace change to Haolong Palace?

97
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,349
Dragon Girl

You want me to find this white lady

109
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:56,849

111
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,099

I heard the nanny passed away

120
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:37,849
The nanny pressed you since you were young. No wonder you hurt the dagger

121
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,599
I hear this bad news

122
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:49,599
I can't eat

123
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,599
The nanny will be laboured all her life, if she has any request left

124
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,849
Son should finish it for her

125
00:13:59,836 --> 00:14:02,099
Nanny what did she say

126
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,599
The nanny said for son to find someone

127
00:14:08,317 --> 00:14:08,963

136
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,599
The lord is really sharp eyed

137
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,849
Even the cheating method will not be renovated

138
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,349
What a disappointment

139
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,599
Pull it down and hit him twenty times

140
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,336
take him away

141
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,849

When you need to use knowledge it is not enough

151
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:06,450
I passed at the top, I am the zhuangyuan scholar

152
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:07,849

153
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:08,599

The essay that I wrote, I am the zhuangyuan scholar

155
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,599
crazy

156
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,099
Mr. Wu Jing wrote a piece of Confucian history

157
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,099
a man Fan'jin became crazy even after 
becoming a lower rank scholar

158
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,599
Not even passed, and this man is crazy

159
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,599
This student is obviously nervous

160
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,849
Check it out, you can't even use a pen

161
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,849
What's your name? Don't be nervous, take it slow

00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,099

163
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:06,849
How dare you?

164
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,099
This is the palace's academic and political discipline Lord Ji

165
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,513
You are Ji Xiaolan

166
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:14,953
You know me?

167
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,849
Ji Xiaolan. It's like a big gong tied to your foot

168
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,349
Wherever you go make a loud fuss

169
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,349
Flattery is nice but not the time

170
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,099
This officer still has to be fair

171
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,849
I'll give you something cheap

172
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,849
Mr Ji, are you smart?

173
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,349
He asked me if I was smart

174
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,849
Really doesn't know anything

175
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,849
I'm afraid you won't understand the paper written by our Mo'chou

176
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,099
i don't understand

177
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,599
Is there anything this world, that I Ji Xiaolan

178
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,849
can't understand?

179
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,349
I tell you that as long as it is written in this ink

180
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,849
I can understand

181
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,349
Can you understand it if it's written in blood?

182
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,599
The imperial examinations is harmful, just went crazy person

183
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,099
It's a pity there's another madman here.

184

Crap essay crap essay

186
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,599
This article is well written

187
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,599
Apart for this bad word, fail

188
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,349

asking you to a banquet

190
00:19:57,693 --> 00:19:59,120
Banquest, no thanks

191
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,599
The people of the government office specially explained

192
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,849
Lord Wu is inviting tonight Yunzhou's

193
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,349
best actor to play at the venue

194
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,099
Best actor? Who?

195
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,099
Du Xiao'yue

196
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,599
Du Xiao'yue never heard of them

197
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,849
thank you Lord Wu for me

198
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:17,849
Just say I couldn't go

199
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,599
There could be the pillars of the country here

200
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,599
Let's not be complacent, go reply

201
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:25,349
lord

202
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,599
Mr Ji, please come over

203
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,599
what's wrong?

204
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,349
Ji lord has come

205
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,349
what's wrong?

206
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,349
Mr Ji you see

207
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,099
Which student's paper is this?

208
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,849
It's written in blood

209
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,849
volume written in blood

210
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,599
I'm afraid you won't understand the paper written by Mo'chou

211
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,849
Can understand it written in blood?

212
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,849
I remembered this guy's name is Mo'chou

213
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,599
You search for local inns now

214
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,599
Arrest of Mo'chou, further trial

215
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,099
before the lord came

216
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,599
Lord Wu captured a criminal called him Mo'chou

217
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,796
But she couldn't have gone to the exam.

218
00:21:24,656 --> 00:21:28,349
Someone must have been an impostor on purpose

219
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,099
impostor

220
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,849
Why would he replace a criminals

221
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,599
Mr Ji burn this

222
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,349
It's outrageous that something like this happens

223
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,849
Not only students have to be killed

224
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,599
Even the chief examiner can't help but feel guilty

225
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,349
we all have to sit together

226
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,349
I know this

227
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,599
I want to know what else you guys have to say

228
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,849
Burn this roll and take another roll

229
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,099
As long as you don't do anything, it should go by calmly

230
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,099
Make big things small,  make small things trivial

231
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,650
Mr Ji can no longer hesitate

232
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,599
Just when I get the chance to hide in Yunzhou Mansion

233
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,099
I thought I could escape the capital's problems

234
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:51,349
Unexpectedly, there are ghosts everywhere

235
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,349
Prepare a sedan chair for me, I want to go to the government office to watch a play

236
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:19,349
the white lady she is the emperor's biological mother

237
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:38,849
Your Majesty, you are a Han Chinese

238
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,099
master master

239
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,099
The play is over, we should go

240
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,599
i want to meet the white lady

241
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,849
Hey, San'er, did you here you are headlining the first show tomorrow?

242
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:33,849
But don't get it wrong

243
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,099
Er'kui Ming'er, you are second

244
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,599
Did you hear? don't make a mistake

245
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,849
You all heard it, didn't you know?

246
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:46,599
Two gents, this is backstage, leave if you have no business

247
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,349
we know we know we know

248
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,849
Our prince thinks the play was very good

249
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,599
wants to look around, look around

250
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,349
please please please

251
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,690
you are the white lady

252
00:26:11,856 --> 00:26:12,816
I am Du Xiaoyue

253
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:14,876
Du Xiaoyue

254
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,143
Yes

255
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,099
Where's Du Xiaoyue, Du Xiaoyue?

256
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,849
Master, Master, Master

257
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,849
Our prefect lord has a banquet tonight

258
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,599
Came specifically to hear Du Xiao'yue singing

259
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,599
How about you have to move now?

260
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:38,099
I'm going

261
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,099
Everyone, play the musical instruments and take the clothes

262
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,849
Hurry up to hear, no hurry

263
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,349
Why do you need an instrument?

264
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,349
Play the qin, can you sing without a qin?

265
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:50,849
Walk

266
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,599
who are you

267
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,599
I am Xu Xian

268
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,099
Lord Wu has a person named Mo'chou, you know

269
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,849
Mo'chou

270
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,849
The one locked up in your government's prison?

271
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:34,849
i want to see her

272
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,599
You can't see her Mr Ji

273
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:41,599
why

274
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,849
This woman is a rebel against the Qing Dynasty and the Ming Dynasty

275
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,099
The imperial envoy lord Fu Kang'an

276
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,849
arrived in Yunzhou to personally supervise the beheading

277
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,099
If the lord sees her, it will inevitably lead to criticism

278
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,599
Fu Kang'an also came, how lively

279
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,849
Lord, you see tonight's entertainment is coming out

280
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,849
watch the play watch the play

281
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,849
Mo'chou

282
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:10,849
Don't mention that Mo'chou, Lord Ji

283
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,099
What is the name of the actor Lord Wu

284
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,349
She is Du Xiao'yue playing the white lady

285
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,849
Du Xiao'yue

286
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,099
Lord Wu, don't let her sing

287
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,599
let her come down to me

288
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,099
Ji lord, you are in a good mood

289
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,849
stop, stop, don't sing

290
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,599
Du Xiao'yue quickly remove the costume

291
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,849
come down to accompany the lord

292
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,099
Outrageous, she was singing fine and now she stops

293
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,099
This Ji Xiao'lan is a moralist in court

294
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,349
I didn't expect that once he is among the commoners

295
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,849
that the true character of the scholar shows

296
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,849
The emperor doesn't know anything, this is how the officialdom is now

297
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,599
Ji Xiao'lan is an official from the capital

298
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,599
It is customary for local officials to treat them well.

299
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,099
Lord, they changed it again

300
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,099
This call to Hujiazhuang is not bad.

301
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,466
Lord Ji Xiao'yue is here

302
00:30:48,633 --> 00:30:49,580
Lord Ji

303
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,349
come, come, sit, sit

304
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,849
sit close sit close

305
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,099
Xiao'yue serve Lord Ji

306
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,349
Pack your glory and wealth

307
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,349
Mr Ji to marking exam papers must be hard work

308
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,599
I toast the lord one cup

309
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,599
The papers are hard to read. I don't understand

310
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,599
Mr Ji is really joking, you're a genius

311
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,599
How can there be an article in the world that you can't understand?

312
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,849
Some articles I just don't understand

313
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:25,849
You can understand it using heart

314
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,099
using heart?

315
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,599
Yes, a heart that loves people

316
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,599
Well said, let's drink to that

317
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,099
Master, Master, don't be too angry

318
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,849
Ji Xiao'lan is well received by Yunzhou Prefecture

319
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,349
If he doesn't appreciate it, he will offend people

320
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,099
Lord Mo'chou is innocent

321
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,599
drink, drink, drink

322
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,349
while listening to the play, let's drink

323
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:19,099
Come on, tell me what's going on

324
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,099
Xiao'yue can't discuss it

325
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,099
Lord please take me to see Mo'chou in prison

326
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,836
You're not Mo'chou?

327
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,103
No she's my sister

328
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,099
I can't figure this out either.

329
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,849
It's better for the lord to ask her about it

330
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,349
ok

331
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,599
Don't believe me but I'm an academic

332
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,599
This scholar cannot go to visit the jail

333
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:40,849
Lord Wu

334
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:44,849
The girl you found Mr Ji is just his type

335
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,099
You see how good they are

336
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:53,099
Seems like a good old friend

337
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,849
He'shen. Ji Xiao'lan doesn't look just like socialising

338
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,349
How do you say that Ji Xiao'lan is also human?

339
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,349
It seems to be very popular

340
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,849
How many corrupt officials have I dealt with

341
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,349
Many of them use this

342
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,599
phrase to plead innocence

343
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,099
It seems that the officials of my Qing Dynasty are human beings

344
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,849
but common people are not human

345
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,849
master, quiter

346
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:22,099
The master is entertaining in the officialdom and making a scene

347
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,349
Ji Xiaolan can't be completely blamed

348
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,849
You are also pleading innocence for him

349
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,849
That's not what I mean, servant is telling the truth

350
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,849
people who are now officials

351
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,849
There are also reasons for being an official.

352
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:37,849
Lord Wu

353
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:40,599
Lady Xiao'yue

354
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:46,099
Lord Wu, Xiao'yue toasts you

355
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,849
You have to drink Xiao'yue's toast

356
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,349
Lord, I see the white lady

357
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,099
not the one you were looking for

358
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:57,349
she is too young

359
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,099
no no no you see where this is the white lady

360
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,349
It's just like Pan Jinlian

361
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:10,599
Good good

362
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,849
Mr Ji here

363
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,599
what

364
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,349
have another drink

365
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:28,099
Simply unsightly

366
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,099
I can't drink anymore I can't

367
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:33,099
Lord Wu, I'm a little too drunk

368
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,349
I want to go first

369
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,849
Mr Ji, you didn't drink much

370
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:43,099
Alcohol is not intoxicating, people are self-intoxicating

371
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,849
Come on, come prepare the sedan

372
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,849
Send Lord Ji back

373
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,256
This Xiao'yue girl will send me home

374
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,099
Then I am going

375
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,099
walk slowly

376
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,599
I'm going ahead first

377
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:04,599
Master, what are you doing?

378
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,849
Ji Xiao'lan is being too disrespectful

379
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,599
You can't do this, you'll reveal your identity

380
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,349
Harmless flirtation is fine

381
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,849
But now he's taking it to far

382
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,849
Lord, don't get angry

383
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,599
Ji Xiao'lan. The scholar's true color is showing

384
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,599
The emperor's words are indeed spot on, a scholar's true colors

385
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,849
Ji Xiao'lan is a gentleman

386
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:25,599
right

387
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,099
see clearly

388
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,849
The token of the prefect Wu is not fake

389
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,099
Lord Wu has ordered that no one can see Mo'chou

390
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,349
Why would there be other people looking for her again today?

391
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:50,099
I said that you, the head of the prison, are really doing your job very well.

392
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,099
I really have to thank you

393
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,849
So I can go back to bed earlier

394
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,599
yes you go tell Lord Wu

395
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,599
He is going to have to do it himself

396
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,599
It's not my business now, also

397
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,099
Fu Kang'an is going to remove him from position

398
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,099
i don't care

399
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,599
I say, prison guard

400
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,849
Forty big paddles, you can't escape. let's go...

401
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:14,099
lord please go to jail please go to jail

402
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,349
What are you talking about, please go to jail, are you cursing me?

403
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,849
No, no, no, please visit the criminal, please visit the criminal

404
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,349
that's more like it

405
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,099
sister, sister, sister

406
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,099
Sister, this is the man from the Capital

407
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,099
Mr. Ji Xiao'lan

408
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,599
You are smoking Ji

409
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,349
yes it's me

410
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,099
You are the one who speaks for the people

411
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,099
Smoking Ji

412
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,849
cannot be faked

413
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,849
Sister Mr Ji read the blood script I wrote

414
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,349
No he's here, him. A good official

415
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,349
Lord Ji...

416
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,349
lady

417
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:58,849
sister

418
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,099
Get up, get up and talk

419
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,849
since last winter

420
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,599
We haven't had a rain

421
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,349
No harvest

422
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,599
Many people sell their sons and daughters

423
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:27,599
The court's disaster relief money and grain were embezzled by local officials

424
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,349
People didn't get a cent

425
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,599
Victims became too hungry to live

426
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,099
Robbed the grain truck but was framed as a violent

427
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,349
I fought my way out of a bloody road and beat the drums

428
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,349
little did I know

429
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,099
How would you know they would falsely accusing you of being

430
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:19,599
a traitor who rebelled against Fuming and then sentence you to death

431
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,599
how do you know sir

432
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,849
I know Mr Ji is the best

433
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,349
this trick it's not new

434
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,849
Mr Ji, you now know that my sister was wronged

435
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,849
hurry up and save her

436
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,349
I'm an academic and I have no power at all

437
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,099
You have no power, you have intelligence

438
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:44,349
Mr Ji. Mo'chou's personal life and death is of no consequence

439
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,849
But those villians are still taking fish and meat from the villagers

440
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,099
Sir, if you don't stand up for justice

441
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,599
People have no hope

442
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,849
the people are still about loyalty

443
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,849
How can I, Ji Xiao'lan, stand idly by?

444
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:00,599
sir

445
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,599
Mr Ji Yunzhou corrupt officials' law bending

446
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,349
all of it has been recordedin a book

447
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,349
an account book

448
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,849
it was a conscientious money food master

449
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,849
He secretly recorded everything

450
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,849
Good teacher, what's his name?

451
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,099
His name is Huang Keming

452
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,599
the unspeakable things that the corrupt officials did

453
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,599
he knows it all

454
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,349
Mo'chou. Such important evidence

455
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,349
Why would he want to give it to you?

456
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,099
because

457
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,599
A sister is his soon to be wife

458
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,349
The virtuous couple is worthy of Ji Xiao'lan's admiration for asking for the people's life

459
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,599
The master is not asleep yet

460
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,599
The emperor is human too

461
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,099
all these years

462
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,349
Suddenly I found myself with another mother

463
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:07,599
another family

464
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,599
I can't sleep at night

465
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,349
The vast sea of ​​people. I only have this half piece of gold lock

466
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,849
When will you find your home?

467
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,099
The emperor's servant believes that you will find it

468
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,849
You are so sincere and God will be moved

469
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,599
Lord Heshen. the late supper is ready

470
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:34,349
I know, i'm coming

471
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,349
Your Majesty, you sit  here. Servant will go quickly and come back

472
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,349
What a delicious bun, how much is it?

473
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,599
three coins

474
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:57,349
Ji Xiaolan went to prison tonight to see Mo'chou

475
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,349
It's not what I expected

476
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:02,599
Immediately notify Fu Kang'an

477
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,599
one more bowl of wonton

478
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,099
Lord Ji, be careful here

479
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:20,599
Xiaoyue, you are very familiar with this Yunzhou

480
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:21,849
Are you from Yunzhou?

481
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,099
I've been sold since I was a kid until here

482
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,349
Growing up in an opera troupe

483
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,849
I don't even know who my parents are

484
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,349
do i have any siblings

485
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:34,599
What kind of person do you think I am?

486
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,099
Lord Ji, you see

487
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,099
don't move

488
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:40,849
government soldiers

489
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,599
How did the government soldiers know we were here?

490
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,099
I do not know either

491
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,349
Fu Kang'an

492
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,349
Mr Ji you really led the traitor here

493
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,099
It's you

494
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:53,599
I

495
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,849
Ji Xiao'lan, you betrayed me

496
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:56,849
no i won't go

497
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,849
Mr Ji here is a dangerous cave, stay for a long time and go

498
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,099
She is not a traitor

499
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,099
She is she is here to whistleblow

500
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,599
Be careful Xiao'yue

501
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,599
Mr Ji this is dangerous

502
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,349

503
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,099
Ji, The people of Yunzhou will never forgive you
