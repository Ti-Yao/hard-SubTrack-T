1
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,599
Mr. Ji, look

2
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,599
don't move

3
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,099
palace soldiers

4
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,599
How did the palace soldiers know we were here?

5
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,599
I do not know either

6
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,849
Fukangan

7
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,599
Mr. Ji really lured the traitor

8
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,349
It's you

9
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,599
I

10
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,349
Ji Xiaolan, you betrayed me

11
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,349
no i won't go

12
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,099
Mr. Ji is here, it's dangerous to stay here, go

13
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,349
she's not a traitor

14
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,099
She is she is here to whistleblow

15
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,599
Be careful

16
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:58,849
Mr. Ji, this is dangerous

17
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,099
Xiaoyue

18
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,599
take her away

19
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,099
The people of Yunzhou will never forgive you

20
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,099
Why are you in an ambush here, Mr Fu?

21
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,349
After Mochou was arrested, we knew that in her hand

22
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,849
was a very important roster

23
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,349
But torturing her in every possible way just doesn't say anything

24
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,849
So we guess

25
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,599
As long as there are two people who Mochou believes in, go

26
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,099
She'll be sure to tell where the roster is hidden

27
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,349
you are using me

28
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,349
any person Du Xiaoyue bringsMochou must also trust

29
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,599
I just needed to follow Mr. Ji

30
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,099
You can catch them without any effort

31
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,599
Fukangan I tell you

32
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,599
That roster is not a roster of rebels

33
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,849
Mr. Ji, how do you know

34
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,849
That's the evidence of corrupt officials

35
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,599
Rebels certainly won't be on the roster

36
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,349
Write down that you want to refute

37
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,849
They will definitely make up their own names to cover their identities.

38
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,599
Mr. Ji as a scholar, you are too naive

39
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,099
Lord Fu, I Mr Ji might be a scholar

40
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,349
But I can tell the difference between good and evil

41
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,099
Du Xiaoyue, beautiful

42
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,849
made a fool of Ji the scholar

43
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,849
It's hilarious

44
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,349
ok i don't explain anything to you

45
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,099
but i tell you

46
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,849
Du Xiaoyue, she's innocent, let it go

47
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,599
Let her go? Ji Xiaolan, you're just scholar

48
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,349
This kind of thing is out of your hands

49
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,599
Well, it's not up to me

50
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,099
But it's up to the emperor

51
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,599
emperor

52
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,099
yes if you don't let go

53
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,099
Ji must report to the emperor

54
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,599
Okay, do you want to see the emperor?

55
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,599
ok, congratulations, majesty

56
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,849
one's own will

57
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,599
Ji Huang is immoral and immoral

58
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,349
Take off the top and get rid of the post for the people

59
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,849
white lady

60
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,349
Lord, we should go back

61
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,349
white lady

62
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,349
what do you say

63
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,099
white lady, who is she

64
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,349
Since the lady, she is the white snake Bai Suzhen

65
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,349
How can the white snake be my mother?

66
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,599
this. servant...

67
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,599
If there was someone who could solve this riddle

68
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,349
That person would be Ji Xiaolan

69
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,849
Master, sevant understands

70
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,599
Lord Ji, please get up

71
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,099
You called wrong, Lord He

72
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,849
This is only the commoner Ji Xiaolan

73
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,599
Come back

74
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,849
Let him go

75
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,849
Folks and fathers, I am Du Xiaoyue

76
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,849
what to shout

77
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,099
Xiaoyue Xiaoyue

78
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,349
Corrupt officials harm the people

79
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,099
You have to help me find justice

80
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,849
Corrupt officials harm the people

81
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,349
You have to help me find justice

82
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,849
Corrupt officials harm the people

83
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,599
You have to help me find justice

84
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,349
Brother, your fireworks are going to explode

85
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,349
How did this happen?

86
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,099
Throw it out, throw it out, throw it out

87
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,099
Brother-in-law, I know you'll come to my rescue

88
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,849
Sister, I've come to help you

89
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,099
Xiaoyue go!. the evidence is important. Go!

90
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:51,849
sister

91
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,349
go fast

92
00:09:59,400 --> 00:09:59,849
Xiaoyue

93
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,599
scum officer is you

94
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,349
give me the ledger in your hand

95
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,349
I'll tear you apart

96
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,849
It's would be a pity to break such a good vase

97
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,599
god is so unfair

98
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,849
Such a good bottle is still broken

99
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,776
go fast

100
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,349
chase them for me

101
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,599
These scum soldiers

102
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,349
search for me

103
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:41,849
Xu Xian

104
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,599
How come there are so many soldiers

105
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,849
leave me alone

106
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,849
If you are caught, you will be implicated too

107
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,849
it's okay no problem

108
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,349
Do you know who I am?

109
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,349
Aren't you the white lady?

110
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,849
I'm a rebel, the official government is chasing me

111
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,599
The government is arresting you

112
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,599
yeah, scared right?

113
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,099
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, come with me

114
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,599
do you know Fahai

115
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,849
That old monk?

116
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,849
I learned invisibility from him

117
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,599
Invisibility

118
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:21,849
can this work

119
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,599
OK, don't look at it, it won't work

120
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,099
give me a careful search

121
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:45,099
Heavenly and Earthly

122
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,349
and lord why are you here

123
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,849
I'll tell you later

124
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,099
What's with this woman, Lord Heshen Mr. Heshen?

125
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,849
Why did the emperor save her?

126
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,099
The emperor is looking for the white lady

127
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,099
white lady

128
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,349
Lord Heshen. That account book

129
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,849
That girl has it

130
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,599
If it was seen by the emperor...

131
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:18,349
The account books are insufficient, we have to worry about Ji Xiaolan

132
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,349
Ji Xiaolan has been dismissed, he's no bother

133
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,349
The general is wrong

134
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,099
The emperor will be angry for a while

135
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,849
He will dismiss Ji Xiaolan for a while

136
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,099
He will find that he cannot do without Ji Xiaolan

137
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:41,099
I understand that Lord Heshen is saying. goodbye.

138
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,599
Ji Xiaolan what will you do next?

139
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,349
Xu Xian, you really know magic

140
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,849
Those people really didn't see

141
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,099
do you really believe

142
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,849
That's because I wrapped you in a costume

143
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,099
Those soldiers saw me carrying a robe

144
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,349
They thought I was an actor too

145
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,349
Oh, those palace soldiers are so stupid

146
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,349
Xiaoyue, do you know the white lady?

147
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,849
Yes I play her

148
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,849
Don't you think I'm a bit like a white lady?

149
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,349
How can there be a white lady like you?

150
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,349
Xiaoyue, think about it carefully

151
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,849
Is there any actor who plays the white lady

152
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,599
who looks a bit like me but older than you

153
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,849
looks like you but older than me?

154
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,599
I think there is

155
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,849
she's a bit like you

156
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,599
what is her name

157
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,849
i don't know her name

158
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,099
I only know her alias

159
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,319
alias?

160
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:41,420
her alias is...

161
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:41,967
Xiaoyue

162
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,420
Come here

163
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,849
Sister, are you alright?

164
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,599
Who is he? what nonsense are you talking with him?

165
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,849
he is good

166
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,849
 On his head is engraved the words "good man"

167
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,099
Sister, you don't know what he just saved me

168
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,349
 Ajier knew that he had just

169
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,599
The villain pretends to be a hero to save the beauty

170
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,599
Lie to your trust, you know that

171
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,099
Your plays are all sung in vain

172
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,599
Xiaoyue, what is the white lady's name?

173
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,349
she seems to

174
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,099
What are you talking about, let's go

175
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,849
Xiaoyue

176
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,599
what is her alias

177
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,349
go

178
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,599
i forgot

179
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,599
go fast

180
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,349
Lord Fu

181
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,599
Lord Wu, do you know?

182
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,349
Someone is gossiping about you in front of the emperor

183
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,099
gossip what gossip

184
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,099
Someone secretly reported you to the emperor

185
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,349
When Ji Xiaolan came to Yunzhou

186
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,349
Lord Wu warmly welcomed him

187
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,099
Saying that the two of you have an extraordinary relationship

188
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,099
Lord Ji Juxiaolan was a scholar at the time

189
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,349
Officer, that was hospitality

190
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,599
It's not anything special

191
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,849
In fact, I have long hated Ji Xiaolan

192
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,849
But the emperor misunderstood himself

193
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,433
Mr. Wu, the color of your official cap feather is about to change

194
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,349
It's really unfair. Lord, your subordinate has been treated unjustly

195
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:27,349
But Lord Wu there is one way

196
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,849
to clear your name

197
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,349
Immediately drive Ji Xiaolan away

198
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,849
Don't leave this scourge anymore, understand?

199
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:56,599
the Emporer came

200
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,599
Come to Yunzhou without a word

201
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,849
what is he doing

202
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,599
Can't figure it out, can't figure it out

203
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,099
Ji Xiaolan, ah Ji Xiaolan

204
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,599
Where are you now the head of a scholar

205
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,599
Just a big pumpkin

206
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,599
There must be a reason

207
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,849
Where is Ji Xiaolan, where is Ji Xiaolan

208
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,349
Lord Wu, this wind and lightning

209
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,599
how come you're here

210
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,349
Listening to your voice, you're not here in friendship

211
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,849
Ji Xiaolan, I've seen you look evil for a long time

212
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,599
That's insincere, the emperor is wise and wise

213
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,349
You have been removed from office

214
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,849
what

215
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,099
People are now banned from the academy grounds without permission.

216
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,599
Someone threw his things out at me

217
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,349
This is a sage's book, you dare throw

218
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,849
goddamn you

219
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,849
Wuzui only judges people by wealth and power

220
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,349
God will punish you

221
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,349
That's my stuff, you give it back to me

222
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:22,099
Still the tiger skin belongs to me

223
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:30,599
Immediately report to Lord Heshen and Lord Fu Kangan

224
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,849
Just say I will take Ji Xiaolan

225
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,849
well repaired

226
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,099
Who dares to let him in the sedan

227
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,599
Stop the sedan for me

228
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,849
Look who is so bold

229
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,396
It's Lord He

230
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,349
Lord Heshen is you

231
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,099
I have kicked the surnamed Ji out of the academy

232
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,849
I even tore his umbrella

233
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,849
let him get soaked

234
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,849
Mr. Ji, come and come, my sedan chair is big

235
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,099
Squeeze the two of us and sit

236
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,349
come, come, Mr. Ji

237
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,099
Thanks, Lord Heshen, return my things

238
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,099
Mr. Ji come, have a drink with He Shen

239
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,599
come, please, please

240
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,349
Isn't this Lord Heshen and Ji Xiaolan mortal enemies?

241
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,099
Why did he come to help him?

242
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,849
I really don't understand

243
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,599
Mr. Ji works too hard, here

244
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,349
Warm up with a cup

245
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,349
This is the king's treasured wine

246
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,849
Lord Heshen brings such a good wine

247
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,349
hosting a newly dismissed employee

248
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,349
you must be asking for something

249
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:18,849
good wine

250
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,849
Ji Xiaolan is Ji Xiaolan

251
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,099
nothing can get past you

252
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,349
Lord Heshen, you've fed me now. What do you need?

253
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,599
sir please see

254
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:37,849
what is this

255
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,599
This is what I was about to ask you

256
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,599
Mr. Ji, who is famous all over the world, will surely know

257
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,849
Mr. Heshen, can I ask for advice?

258
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,849
where does this thing come from

259
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,849
This thing involves a major case in Beijing

260
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,849
it's the only line of inquiry

261
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,099
Sir please advise

262
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,599
This lock is called a longevity lock

263
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,599
worn by newborn babies

264
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,099
everywhere on the street

265
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,099
However

266
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,599
Fire's gone out

267
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,599
fire, come, light it

268
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,849
Just now you said

269
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,349
Lord Heshen this piece of gold

270
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,099
It is indeed different from other golden locks

271
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,349
Honestly, Mr. Ji said

272
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,849
I don't know how much I've seen this

273
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,099
I don't see anything special.

274
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,849
let go

275
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,349
There's nothing here

276
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,599
I'm knocking the ashes

277
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,599
Don't knock on this and you'll light it on fire

278
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,349
This lock is not special, thousands like it

279
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,599
But the goldsmiths who make locks

280
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,849
will leave a mark on themselves

281
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,099
mark

282
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,349
Did you see that there is a mountain spring?

283
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,599
This is a famous goldsmith in Yunzhou

284
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,099
Lin Xiaoquan's special mark

285
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,599
Mr. Ji, where does Lin Xiaoquan live now?

286
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,599
Now? I heard

287
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,849
This Lin Xiaoquan is now living in the Confucian Temple.

288
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,349
Thanks for Mr. Ji's information

289
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,599
come and drink

290
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,726
Mr. Ji all the way

291
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:10,586
Here

292
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,027
Ji Xiaolan, have a quick journey

293
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,599
Mr. Heshen, many thanks

294
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,599
let's go

295
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:21,349
goodbye

296
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,849
How come Ji Xiaolan, Lord Heshen, is leaving without a fuss

297
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,349
I got him out of a nice mess

298
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,599
Let him go back to Beijing to teach a few little babies to read

299
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,099
He just scuttled away

300
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,599
Lord Heshen is worthy of being the contemporary Confucious

301
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,099
Would not dare to be

302
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,099
But with Ji Xiaolan gone

303
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,349
We can really sit back and relax

304
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,349
But the gang of disaster victims are making trouble.

305
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:57,599
Let the adults help

306
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,349
don't worry about that

307
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:03,849
As long as we let the emperor look for his birth mother

308
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,599
He won't care about anything else

309
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:09,849
Lord He, let's go

310
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:21,599
He Aiqing, you are complex

311
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,599
Trivial, emporer doesn't need to mention it

312
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,349
I've been thinking about this golden lock day and night, but I didn't have any clues

313
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,599
Unexpectedly Heshen Aiqing

314
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,849
can actually find out about this Lin Xiaoxiaoquan

315
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,599
I am surprised

316
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,599
it's like this

317
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,099
Servant arrived in Yunzhou, day and night to check the darkness

318
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,349
Finally found Lin Xiaoquan's whereabouts

319
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,349
Then went to the cottage and asked questions

320
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,099
Only then did I notice the signature on the golden lock

321
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,849
I'm moved by He Aiqing's effort

322
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,099
You flatter me, the emperor is finding his mother

323
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,099
This filial piety makes the world feel moved

324
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,349
Heshen long decided

325
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,099
to help the emperor to uncover the truth of his life

326
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,599
He Shen, f I find my biological mother

327
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,599
you are the first to know

328
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,849
you flatter me, the emporer's most fortunate day

329
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,599
The slave is just shined a little light on it

330
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,599
The two masters are looking for Lin Xiaoquan

331
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:37,599
how do you know

332
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,099
Lin Xiaoquan is just waiting here

333
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,099
How did he know we were coming

334
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,349
He said you were for the golden lock

335
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,099
He is waiting for you at the Guandi Temple next to the Confucius Temple

336
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,099
This Lin Xiaoquan is simply a living sage

337
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,099
Master lead the way

338
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,453
two gentlemen

339
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,099
Lin Xiaoquan said that the two can only advance one

340
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,849
That's big talk does he knows we are?

341
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,849
Who does he want to see

342
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,849
He said which of the two of you is uglier

343
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,349
stays outside the door

344
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:46,599
Then you go in

345
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,349
Welcome your Majesty

346
00:26:59,150 --> 00:26:59,849
Ji Xiaolan

347
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,099
Minister here, the emperor

348
00:27:03,406 --> 00:27:06,349
Where is Lin Xiaoquan?

349
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,349
This Lin Xiaoquan was made up by the minister

350
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,849
you made it up

351
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,349
Then Heshen, he clearly told me

352
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,849
Only by using this method

353
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,099
Could Heshen lead you here

354
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,349
You and Heshen are bragging together

355
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:56,599
Ji Xiaolan

356
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,349
Do you know why I fired you?

357
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:01,849
please express, your Majesty

358
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,349
only after you became a commoner

359
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,349
did you help me with the secret investigation

360
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,349
your Majesty

361
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,349
I received a lot of  secret memos in the palace

362
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,099
Said that the food for disaster relief here

363
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,349
almost all of it was stolen

364
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,349
Up to the Governor and Governor down to Daofu Prefecture

365
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:18,849
collective corruption

366
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,849
I'm afraid this case is not easy to investigate.

367
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,849
I have already sent two batches of officials to investigate.

368
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,349
all in vain

369
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,099
A public inspection of such a case would be very effective

370
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,349
So, Your Majesty, you have to go undercover yourself

371
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,099
I realised when I arrived in Yunzhou

372
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,599
It's not that simple

373
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,849
It doesn't matter where I go

374
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,599
there are people who warn them first

375
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,849
I will never see the truth

376
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,099
That's when it's inconvenient to be the emperor

377
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,599
The same goes for being an official

378
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,849
If you are a political and local official, there is no reason not to flatter you

379
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,849
Food and wine plus beautiful women

380
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,849
but now you are a commoner it is much easier

381
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,849
You can definitely reveal the truth for me

382
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,599
The minister Ji Juxiaolan will never fail my emperor

383
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,099
In Ji Aiqing's opinion, where should one start?

384
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,349
The emperor should return to the capital immediately

385
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,599
Local officials can relax their vigilance

386
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,599
that will reveal all

387
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,599
I'll just do that. Heshen come in!

388
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,099
Emperor, Mr. Ji is also here

389
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,720
Heshen, where is Lin Xiaoquan?

390
00:29:40,686 --> 00:29:43,312
Emporer, it's like this

391
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,349
I felt deeply that you could not let go of Ji Xiaolan

392
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:51,349
Therefore, this method is specially used to make the ruler and minister meet as soon as possible.

393
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,349
Hurry up and get your car back to the capital

394
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,349
Brother Huang, you are still not resting

395
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,849
yeah that ledger is missing

396
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,349
Write it down while my memory is still fresh

397
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,099
Officials protect each other, where can you go to sue you?

398
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,349
Unexpectedly, even Ji Xiaolan is so evil

399
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,099
Complain to the Imperial City

400
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,849
don't worry, you're afraid

401
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,099
I will accompany Brother Ming when going up to the Sword Mountain and down to the Sea of Fire

402
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,099
Who

403
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,349
I gonna go see

404
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,099
Brother Huang, officers and soldiers. flee

405
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,349
Mochou go quickly

406
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,599
freeze

407
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,599
Brother Huang

408
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,349
Mochou go quickly

409
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,349
Xiaoyue and the brothers can't be take care of themselves, go quickly

410
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,349
You go first!

411
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,849
If it doesn't work out

412
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,599
All the people in the disaster area have to starve to death, hurry up

413
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:38,099
Brother Huang

414
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,849
Why don't you listen to even my words?

415
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:28,349
He Shenqi. Enjoy

416
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,849
tell them to get out of the way

417
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,099
move apart

418
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,849
don't hurt them

419
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,349
they are my subordinates

420
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,099
Sister, why don't you let them go?

421
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:50,599
Take them all back

422
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:56,599
go up

423
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,599
I don't know enough, I really don't know enough

424
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,099
I didn't see such a little trick.

425
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:14,349
ashamed

426
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,849
natural calamities and man-made misfortunes are accidents

427
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,099
Aiqing, don't blame yourself

428
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:26,099
Ji Xiaolan, you are too presumptuous, this is for the emperor

429
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,349
Lord He, if you want to save the emperor

430
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,099
then I'm the only one who should sit here

431
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,349
Are you insane?

432
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:37,849
What's the matter with sitting or not sitting and getting out? Get up!

433
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,349
Ji Xiaolan

434
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,599
how do we get out

435
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,099
There are three possible ways for the emperor to escape

436
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:49,599
Number one

437
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,599
I sit and you stand

438
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,349
Number 2

439
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,349
Let Lord Heshen come and massage my back

440
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,599
in your dreams

441
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,349
Lord Heshen, you said

442
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,099
you would save the emperor even if you died

443
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:05,849
of course

444
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,349
Then why can't you massage my back?

445
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,599
what does this have to do with this

446
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,349
Of course

447
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,849
Heshen, do it...

448
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,349
I...

449
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,349
massage

450
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,349
work harder

451
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,599
Ji Xiaolan, the third point

452
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:33,849
The emperor pardon me

453
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,849
point three... I can't tell you for the time being.

454
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:37,599
Are you having fun?

455
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,349
you two bastards!

456
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:47,887
bastards!?

457
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,349
You are actually dared call us bastards

458
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,599
Not just bastards but losers

459
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,849
You've done me such a disservice

460
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,349
You are crazy, I will fight you

461
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,599
This scum official treats his subordinates
so poorly

462
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,849
He's really bad.

463
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,099
oh you've fallen

464
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,349
tell you as soon as I'm out

465
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,349
I'm going to banish you thousands of miles away

466
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,099
I'll let you never come back home

467
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,849
Crazy, this is crazy, I'll kill you

468
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,599
This is the third point

469
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,349
Ji Xiaoan you're locked away, and you still want to make threats

470
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:27,849
stand up

471
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,099
You two listen to me

472
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,849
No matter how long I'm stuck here

473
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,099
you have to also be stuck here

474
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,599
You, come and massage me

475
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,599
You, you have to pack me a cigar pot

476
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,349
Don't listen to the scum officer Xu Xian, come

477
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,849
We are all poor brothers

478
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,599
I'm on your side

479
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,849
scum officer won't try to bully you with me here

480
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,849
don't listen to her

481
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:50,849
You are not all the same

482
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,349
They're all locked up with me in this pile of stinky fish

483
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,599
who said they are locked here, I can let them go

484
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,599
You little girl, you have a big mouth

485
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,349
what are you capable of

486
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,849
If you want to let them go, you have to ask your boss's permission

487
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,099
you have no influence

488
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,599
let me tell you, we came today

489
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,099
just to get you scum officer

490
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,349
we had no intention of arresting your subordinates

491
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,849
It was my sister who asked me to come and see

492
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,099
if they are officials too

493
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:15,099
yes! they are also officials

494
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,099
You are arresting both was correct

495
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,436
you lying to me again!

496
00:36:19,257 --> 00:36:22,710
No, he's the emporer!

497
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,849
He's the Minister of Defence and they're both higher rank than me

498
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,349
girl you arrested the right people

499
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,349
You think I'm a three year old

500
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,099
Both of them are higher rank than you?

501
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,849
He was massaging you just now

502
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,599
I saw it all outside the door

503
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,599
Girl I'm telling the truth

504
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,849
you must believe me

505
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:43,599
emperor?

506
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,099
Why am I not like the emperor?

507
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:48,849
Does the emperor look like you?

508
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,849
Look, you are a sturdy. You must lift the sedan chairs

509
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,849
a lifter? You really have a good eye

510
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,599
What about him? Does he look like a minister?

511
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,849
let's see

512
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:06,599
White and fat. he must sell tofu

513
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,849
nothing gets past you

514
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,099
Girl, what are you looking at?

515
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:12,849
shut up

516
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,099
I'm here today to fight for the poor brothers

517
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,099
you two come with me

518
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,099
what about him

519
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,349
stay. let's go

520
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,849
It's not fair. Your lord is sitting here

521
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,599
Your Lord is sitting here on the stinky fish

522
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,599
while you servants are free. You've put your foot in it now

523
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,099
Sister I've checked it out

524
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,599
two of them, one is a butler

525
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,099
one is a servant, neither of them are officials

526
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,849
Looking at your fancy clothes...

527
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,349
it's like this

528
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,349
We are working for the big family

529
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,849
gotta keep up the facade

530
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,599
In fact, inside and out

531
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,349
we only have one kind of these clothes

532
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,099
Sister, let them go, we're all suffering people

533
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,599
Besides, this Xu Xian also saved me.

534
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,849
ok let them go

535
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,099
Xu Xian, didn't I say

536
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,349
Our elder sister is the most concerned about the poor brothers

537
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:27,599
Thank you ma'am and thank you ma'am

538
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,849
Then let's go

539
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,599
wait

540
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,099
Take some silver taels and send them to two brothers

541
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,099
The two of you sit here for a while

542
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,849
Let you sit, just sit

543
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,349
sit

544
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,599
butler, servant

545
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,849
Yes, what's the matter

546
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,849
Have you ever seen a butler look after a servant?

547
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:25,849
butler serving servant

548
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,099
sister

549
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,599
Do you know how much this emerald finger is worth?

550
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,349
two buckets of fish

551
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:43,599
let them speak for themselves

552
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,349
I didn't expect you to be so stupid

553
00:39:58,650 --> 00:39:59,349
what are you talking about

554
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,849
I was just dusting the chair

555
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,599
Respectfully asking the Holy Master to sit first

556
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,849
Who knew that woman was so tricky

557
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,849
You

558
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,349
You are so used to sucking up to the emperor

559
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,599
even when you shouldn't

560
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,599
OK, OK, OK

561
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:12,849
He said I was sucking up

562
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:17,849
How dare you three scum officials lie to me

563
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,599
Made me get told off by my older sister

564
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,849
I didn't lie to you, girl

565
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,349
I told you that the two of them are officials, you don't believe me

566
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,099
All three of you are no good

567
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,849
girl, let us three go

568
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,349
I'll ensure Huang Keming is okay and returns you wealth and glory

569
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,349
I won't be fooled by you, quick write

570
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,349
write what? to write a couplet?

571
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:39,099
Then my Ji Xiaolan's couplet is the best in the world

572
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:39,849
I'll do it

573
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,349
Who wants you to write some stupid couplets

574
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,849
Write a letter to Mr. Wu in Yunzhou Prefecture

575
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,349
Tell him to let brother Ming go

576
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,599
Otherwise, the three of you are dead

577
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,349
You see I said they were there to save Huang Keming

578
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,099
You are here to rescue Huang Keming

579
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,099
The one who just caught the court's scum officials?

580
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,599
You are so righteous

581
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,599
Girl, do you remember when you said

582
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,099
There is a actress who plays the white lady

583
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,099
You want to know her nickname again, right?

584
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,349
Yeah, what's her nickname?

585
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,349
want to know but I won't tell you

586
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,349
Don't listen to her, how does she know what nickname

587
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,099
she's bragging

588
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,599
Who doesn't know her nickname

589
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,099
Our sister said

590
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,849
I can't talk to you three scum officials. write quickly

591
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,349
Huang Keming, do you know what I'm here for?

592
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,599
come to kill me

593
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,599
Wrong, I'm here to tell you a story

594
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,599
I said how old are you

595
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,849
What are you tinkering with? It's fishy and smelly

596
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,849
You're not putting the emperor's safety first

597
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:05,599
Mr. Ji must be looking for something

598
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,349
of course the emperor knows me, emperor

599
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:09,849
what do you want

600
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,599
That half golden lock

601
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:14,099
I have never disclosed any rumors

602
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,099
You can guess that I have this item

603
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:20,099
You must have revealed it.

604
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,599
Servant wouldn't dare

605
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,349
Only you know my secret

606
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:25,599
if it wasn't you, who did?

607
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:31,099
The emperor's servant is guilty, servant is guilty and deserves death

608
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:31,849
okay, okay

609
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,599
The emperor and Lord He is not only innocent

610
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,599
You should also reward him

611
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,349
you don't have to speak for him

612
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,099
Lord Heshen holding the half of the golden lock

613
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,349
drew it as a picture and came to me

614
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,349
He didn't say it was the emperor's thing

615
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:43,599
but told me

616
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,349
it was some evidence in a case, right?

617
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,349
You could guess that it was mine

618
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:54,099
The emperor and Lord Shen have worked with ministers a lot

619
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,599
never asked a minister for help of his own affairs

620
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:58,599
he only has the interest of the emporer

621
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,349
He was willing to come to me and not be ashamed to ask

622
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,099
Then why did you come to ask me?

623
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,599
Since the emperor didn't tell me

624
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,349
It must be the emperor's secret

625
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:10,849
How could I dare to ask?

626
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,849
Then why do you dare to ask me now?

627
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,849
Your Majesty, we are now at the end of our lives.

628
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,849
Surely not, as long as the Yunzhou government releases Huang Keming

629
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,099
we'll be fine

630
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,099
The case of Huang Keming is now in the hands of Fukangan

631
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,599
Fukangan has a strong temperament and will not be threatened into obedience

632
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:33,849
He will not let Huang Keming go

633
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:36,599
then we're finished, all finished

634
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:42,849
He does't know the hostage is the emperor

635
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:43,349
Please look
