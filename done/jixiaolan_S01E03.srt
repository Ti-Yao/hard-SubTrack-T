1
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,349
Does Huang Keming know what I'm here for?

2
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,349
to kill me, right?

3
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,849
Wrong, I'm here to tell you a story

4
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,849
Back in the day, Emperor Kangxi had two princes

5
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,349
One is the fourth Lord Ziyong

6
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,849
When Lord Kangxi died

7
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,849
There are legends that the throne was to pass onto the fourteenth Lord

8
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,099
It was Emperor Yongzheng who changed it to the fourth Lord

9
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:29,599
That's just a rumor

10
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,599
But after Yongzheng ascended the throne

11
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,349
the fourteenth was most worried

12
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,599
And the first person to ordered under house arrest was also him

13
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,349
what's the royal business with me

14
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,599
After Qianlong ascended the throne

15
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,349
Did they release the fourteenth Lord

16
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,599
The Fourteenth Lord is currently in Yunzhou Mansion

17
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,099
If you have something to say, please say it directly

18
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,099
you can take all your crimes

19
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,099
and blame it all on the fourteenth Lord

20
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,599
what

21
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,599
What the emperor fears most is the usurper

22
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,349
As long as you say that all the crimes are the mastermind of the Fourteenth Lord

23
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,099
the emperor will definitely believe you

24
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,099
Then you can take it easy and be free

25
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,599
Huang Keming vindicates the people

26
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,349
I would never do that immoral thing

27
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,099
Huang Keming is a hero who knows current affairs

28
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,599
you can think about it

29
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,349
You also have a share of the government's corruption disaster food.

30
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,599
I've seen that ledger with your name on it

31
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,349
You are the real mastermind behind the scenes

32
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,599
I see that you refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit

33
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,099
Well, I will fulfill your wish

34
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,349
come

35
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,849
Send the rebels to the execution ground to be beheaded to the public

36
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,849
let go of me let go of me

37
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,349
Lord, spare him

38
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,849
Lord Wu, the imperial envoy patrols the kingdom on behalf of the emperor

39
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,099
You say I can't kill him?

40
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,599
That's not what I mean, look

41
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,349
who has no mother

42
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,099
My biological mother is probably in Yunzhou

43
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,599
she may be looking forward to

44
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,099
meeting her biological son

45
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,099
The emperor's filial piety

46
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,099
God will be moved

47
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,349
Mr. Ji, please help me find my biological mother

48
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,849
The people of Emperor Yunzhou

49
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,349
is living in the depths of ice and heat

50
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,099
The emporer's biological mother may also be there

51
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:09,099
Mr. Ji speaks with hidden meaning

52
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,349
Emporer, please take a look

53
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,599
sir this is

54
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,599
Emporer , this is an account book

55
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,599
It was preserved by Huang Keming at the risk of his death.

56
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,349
Also Du Xiaoyue

57
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,849
They took a risk to bring me to the opera in order to retrieve this

58
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,599
Look at the emperor

59
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,599
Please the emperor give back to the people in the disaster area

60
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,950
hurry up and hide

61
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:47,349
quick move it

62
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,599
This basket can't be moved

63
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,599
Why can't this basket be moved?

64
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,349
You can't move the fish behind me

65
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,599
I'm going to move it, move away

66
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,599
you see she can't

67
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:00,849
what is this

68
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,349
don't bother yourself

69
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,599
Girl, this book is very important

70
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,599
give it back to us

71
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,849
Xiaoyue, quickly open the account book

72
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,349
That's Huang Keming's ledger

73
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,099
fatso, why didn't you just say

74
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:14,849
I just tried it and wanted to tell

75
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,349
I was just about to tell...

76
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:17,849
,aybe I just don't want to tell you

77
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,033
No no no Xiaoyue don't fool around

78
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,349
Sir, do you want to let Huang Keming go?

79
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,099
You are crazy, if we let go Huang Keming

80
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,849
Your embezzlement of food for disaster relief

81
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,099
will all be exposed

82
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,349
I can't even protect you

83
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,849
There has been no news from the emperor recently

84
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,599
Was he be kidnapped too?

85
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,349
emperor

86
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,599
Get someone to identify this ring right now

87
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,849
Lord Fu, even you can't see the authenticity of this ring

88
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,849
Don't expect anyone else

89
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,099
Did you forget that there is still fourteenth lord

90
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,349
Fourteenth lord, but he is a criminal

91
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,599
The subordinate dare not see him

92
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,849
Only the fourteenth lord can tell if this is a royal item

93
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,599
If it's really the emperor, then it's an emergency

94
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,099
Don't be sad, Mr. Ji

95
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,599
That book will be destroyed.

96
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,849
It's probably God's will

97
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,849
Lord He, you can easily think past it

98
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,099
Okay, let's have fun

99
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,599
rejoice in pain

100
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,099
Yeah you see we have so many fish

101
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,349
Let's use fish as the theme, words flow from the mouth as from the pen of a master

102
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,349
Whoever can't keep up can be punished

103
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,599
using fish to make speeches?

104
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,349
I'll listen to Mr Ji

105
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,599
The emperor has approved , then I will go first

106
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,349
good

107
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,849
pass off the sham as the genuine

108
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,866
fish turns to dragon

109
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:52,426
fish... fish...

110
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,349
Lord Yu Heshen is calling the horses to stop

111
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,099
You think I can't keep up, listen up

112
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:06,123
Fish, big fish eat small fish, small fish eat krill

113
00:10:09,077 --> 00:10:10,477
No literary interest, punish!

114
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,349
penalty! moving a basket

115
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,599
How could the dignified minister move the fish? Don't make trouble

116
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,099
Lord Heshen, you don't want the emperor to find his biological mother

117
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,099
What has the fish got to do with it?

118
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,349
certainly

119
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,849
Servant is going to move it

120
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,599
Hey, Lord Heshen, move the ones from there to here

121
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,099
ok let's go again

122
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,849
But this time louder

123
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,766
That's right, so the outside can hear. deliver letters

124
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,849
rafters for fish

125
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,349
Jiang Taigong's fishing volunteer takes the bait

126
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,349
It's alright now, I have a story

127
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,349
vulgar

128
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,099
punish again

129
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,599
What are the three of them doing in Xiaoyue

130
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,349
The three of them seem to be having a word battle

131
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,349
The fat guy loses every time

132
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,099
Watch them carefully, Brother Huang's life

133
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,849
relies on these three dogs

134
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,456
I know

135
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,363
let's go

136
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,849
get out of the way

137
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,849
drop car drop car drop car

138
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,599
lords please

139
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,349
Lord Wu, the prefect of Yunzhou, asked to see the Fourteenth Lord

140
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,099
please

141
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,849
Lady Four

142
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:16,849
Mr. Wu

143
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,099
please Lady Four

144
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,099
Wu has a request to see the Fourteenth Lord

145
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,599
Lord Fourteen is not feeling well today

146
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,349
What's the matter, just tell me?

147
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,599
This is not a small matter

148
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,599
I must ask the fourteenth brother to enlighten me

149
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,183
Of course, I have to ask the Lady Four to ask or me.

150
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,099
Wu will await respectfully

151
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,349
what's the matter

152
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,599
The prefect of Yunzhou sent this ring

153
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,349
Said it was no small matter

154
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,099
The owner of the ring has been taken by a group of kidnappers

155
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,599
Please identify it

156
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,349
Lord

157
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,616
the Emporer

158
00:13:34,983 --> 00:13:36,523
the emporer?

159
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,599
This is the stuff of Emporer

160
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,970
This is the stuff of Lord Kangxi

161
00:13:46,137 --> 00:13:47,730
this only passes to princes

162
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,599
It was passed on to Yongzheng and then...

163
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,099
The kidnapped hostage must be Qianlong

164
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,599
The kidnappers asked the government to hand over criminal Huang Keming

165
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,349
Otherwise, all three hostages will be executed

166
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,599
Don't these kidnappers know

167
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,099
that they have tied up the current emperor?

168
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,849
Lord, this is a God-given opportunity.

169
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,599
If Qianlong died, the world would be in chaos

170
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,849
Lord, you can make a comeback

171
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:49,849
no no no I'm old

172
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,099
This world should be yours

173
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,849
Kangxi's edict passed on the throne to Lord Fourteen

174
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,099
This ring was meant to be on your hand

175
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:08,349
Passed onto Lord Fourteen

176
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,849
don't mention it again

177
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,599
If not for Yongzheng usurping the throne

178
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,849
You were supposed to be sitting on the throne in the Qing Dynasty

179
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:25,599
Now the heaven has eyes to kill Qianlong with the hands of kidnappers

180
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,099
Lord, your revenge will be here

181
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,599
Lady Four

182
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,349
Lord, kidnappers demanded that the hostage be replaced by Huang Kepeng

183
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,349
as long as he dies

184
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:45,599
The hostages will be torn apart and Qianlong will die

185
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,099

I know  the driver was the emperor

283

00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,099
Who is bigger than the emporer

285

they set the prison on fire

314
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,849
They say all prisoners in jail are dead

315
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,849
You didn't see Huang Keming's body

316
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,349
girl, listen to me

317
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,099
The two who escaped just now

318
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,099
It is indeed the official of the imperial court.

319
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,599
It's a high official and they will definitely come back to save me

as long as you keep me alive

321

Big brother, you wish

361
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,849

368
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,349
If it weren't for Fu Kang'an's heroic rescue

369
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,349
saving Huang Keming, then I would have filled this prison with you all

370
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:33,349
It was my inability to hold the prison, damn me

371
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,349
The emperor, the fire was suspicious

372
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,099
The fire didn't burn sooner nor later

373
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,599
Only as soon as the emperor's ring arrived

374
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,849
There must be someone who did this

375
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,849
Mr. Wu, who has seen this ring?

376
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,349
Fourteenth Lord

377
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,099
Then he should know this ring is mine

378
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,849
no, the fourteenth lord said

379
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,599
This ring was stolen by tomb robbers

380
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,599
stolen by tomb robbers

381
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,099
This is the stuff of Kangxi's ancestors

382
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,599
Why is he talking nonsense?

383
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,849
let me investigates the rebels

384
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,099
The clues are all implicated to the fourteenth Lord

385
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,599
fourteenth Lord uncle

386
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,599
Letting people burn Huang Keming is equivalent to putting the emperor to death

387
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,599
Fourteenth Lord is notorious

388
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,599
do not talk

389
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,349
The emperor rests his anger, as I see it

390
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,849
let's find out the whereabouts of Ji Xiaolan first.

391
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,599
Best way to rescue him

392
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,349
He Aiqing makes sense

393
00:29:37,663 --> 00:29:38,570
I can send people to search

394
00:29:38,636 --> 00:29:39,099
don't have to

395
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,599
No need, Huang Keming is not dead

396
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,349
They must exchange Ji Xiaolan

397
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,849
We just need to wait for news

398
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,099
Emperor is wise

399
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,099
Emporer, the thief shot another an arrow with a letter

400
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,099
leave

401
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,099
emporer

402
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,599
They want us to send Huang Keming out of the government office tomorrow

403
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,599
Emperor you really anticipated this

404
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,349
Wu Zui

405
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,099
minister here

406
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,349
How is Huang Keming now?

407
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,599
Emperor, Huang Keming was not burnt

408
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,599
After the doctor's diagnosis and treatment, there is no serious problem

409
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,599
Send Huang Keming out of the residence on time tomorrow

410
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,349
must not have any mistakes

411
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,849
I obey

412
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,599
Emperor, I lead a team to follow secretly

413
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,849
all can be captured

414
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,599
You can't beat the grass and startle the snake

415
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,599
Emperor, this Huang Keming is the leader of the rebels

416
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,849
Let the tiger return to the mountain and we'll suffer endless troubles

417
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,099
As long as Ji Xiaolan can return safely

418
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,099
I won't pursue their crimes

419
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,349
Sister, the street is quiet today

420
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,863
It's weird that the government is closed

421
00:30:53,923 --> 00:30:54,849
is a little strange

422
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,349
Sister, look! Brother Huang

423
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,599
Thank goodness I was saved

424
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:15,849
big brother

425
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,099
Mochou

426
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:23,599
Brother Huang

427
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,349
You are Huang Keming who worked for the people's lives. Good man

428
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,599
Thanks

429
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,599
Brother, let's go

430
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,099
wait

431
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,099
who dares to move, he will die

432
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,599
move back

433
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,349
Lord Fu

434
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:45,849
back off

435
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,099
Brother Huang, let's go

436
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,599
Xiaoyue Brother Huang is back

437
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,349
i should get off

438
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,599
Letting you go now, aren't we courting death?

439
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,849
we'll let you go out of town

440
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:03,599
Get out of the city

441
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,099
don't chase

442
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,849
when do they invite me to their wedding toast

443
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,099
If you win the case

444
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,849
Big Brother Huang Big Brother Huang

445
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:38,099
scum officials! you let people go and still kill them

446
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,349
run, run, run

447
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:41,849
run, run, run

448
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,849
Brother Huang

449
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,349
It's so poisonous

450
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,599
what poison

451
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,849
This arrow is smeared with deadly poison

452
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,599
Brother Huang

453
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,099
Huang Keming, you have to hold on!

454
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,099
Brother Huang

455
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:32,099
White lady is really a lady

456
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:32,349
since

457
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,349
Take that dog officer

458
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,849
Walk

459
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,849
Brother Ming. The government didn't let you live

460
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,849
I will  be the sacrifice of the scum officials to you today

461
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,099
Girls, this debt has a head and it must be paid

462
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,349
but I didn't shoot that poison arrow.

463
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:03,849
It was done by your people

464
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,349
Mochou

465
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,099
Do you know what two bird with one stone is?

466
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:07,849
that poison arrow

467
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,599
Obviously someone trying to hurt me

468
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,849
You should keep these words for Big Brother Huang.

469
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:19,099
I'll tell Big Brother Huang

470
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,349
before you let me die

471
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,599
I'll give him a blessing, okay?

472
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,599
Ask the scum officer to first kowtow to Big Brother Huang and confess his guilt

473
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,349
Huang Keming, Huang Keming

474
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,599
You are for the people in the disaster area

475
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,349
In my heart you are one good man

476
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,099
I, Ji Xiaolan, kneel down for you

477
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,849
Sister, he really knelt down

478
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:42,849
What the scum officer does in order to survive

479
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,599
Huang Keming, ah Huang Keming, although you are a good man

480
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,349
But the group of people you brought are stupid

481
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,099
who do you scold

482
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,099
Although the arrow hit you

483
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,099
the purpose was to kill me

484
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,349
The discerning person can see this

485
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,099
But some people just want to take this

486
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,099
they want to sacrifice my head to you

487
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,599
Be someone else's murder tool

488
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,849
Are you saying she's not an idiot?

489
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,349
Sister, he is scolding you

490
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,349
he is trying to change the rhetoric.

491
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,849
He is an official from the imperial court

492
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,849
this scum officer is not of low rank

493
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,849
If you kill the scum official, the court will be shocked

494
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,349
Only then can people in the disaster area have justice

495
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,599
Shanping County should have stockpiled food for disaster relief

496
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,599
ninety-three thousand six hundred and eighty-five

497
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,099
Now there is 36,232 stone eight less food

498
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,599
Baoyi County Baoyi County should have grain in stock

499
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,599
Thirteen thousand six hundred and thirty-two stone eight

500
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,849
Now less than eight thousand three hundred and sixty-two stone three

501
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,599
Sister, he is reciting the ledger

502
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,849
How much do you remember?

503
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,099
I have memorized all of Huang Keming's account books

504
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,849
How can you get it in two days?

505
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,349
I only need to read it once and I can remember it all

506
00:36:59,650 --> 00:36:59,896
you're lying

507
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,599
why should i lie

508
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,849
Huang Keming gave me this ledger

509
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,599
I think it's important

510
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,849
So I take it very seriously

511
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,849
when i have time

512
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,099
I copied it down to present it to the emperor

513
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,349
This is hard evidence of corrupt officials

514
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,349
Sister, did you hear?

515
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,849
As long as this scum is here

516
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,349
Brother Huang's account book will be saved

517
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,849
It's impossible that no one could remember it all

518
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,849
But he just recited the account

519
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,349
Sister, don't kill him

520
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:24,599
let him rewrite the ledger

521
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:28,099
yeah so you can't kill me

522
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,849
if you kill me

523
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,849
Your big brother Huang's work will be in vain

524
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,599
Sister, then you really can't kill him.

525
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,099
Ji Xiaolan has no news yet

526
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,099
These kidnappers have no credibility, they won't let go

527
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,349
I knew that we shouldn't have let Huang Keming go.

528
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:59,849
But what Du Xiaoyue sings is the white lady

529
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,599
Will Ji Xiaolan be in the troupe?

530
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,599
There are one or two opera troupes in the north and south of Yunzhou.

531
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,349
If you add the amateur trupes, you will not be able to count.

532
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:19,099
we have to check them all but there is no Du Xiaoyue

533
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,849
I checked every one, but there is no du

534
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,349
But which opera house is playing The Legend of the White Snake now?

535
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,849
Coincidentally

536
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,599
None of opera houses are playing the white lady

537
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,099
I can't save Ji Xiaolan, I have failed as a man

538
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:14,849
Lord, you can see clearly

539
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,849
it's really him

540
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:23,099
Qianlong, he's so lucky

541
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,849
To escape from the kidnappers

542
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,849
He looks too much like Yongzheng

543
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,599
Lady Four, what are you going to do?

544
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,349
Lord, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

545
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,349
Can't kill Qianlong

546
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,349
You forgot how Yongzheng treated you

547
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,599
After Qianlong ascended the throne, he let me go

548
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,349
This bit of hypocrisy moved you?

549
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,599
why don't you think about it

550
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,849
The throne in the Qing Dynasty was originally yours

551
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,349
But the country is also the country of the Qing Dynasty

552
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,099
The Great Qing Dynasty

553
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,099
You see Qianlong travels in the mountains and waters

554
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,599
This country has become his playground

555
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,349
How does such an emperor govern the country in this way?

556
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:33,849
write quickly

557
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,349
Hey, I told you to write, did you hear me?

558
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:41,849
what am I writing?

559
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,349
Write out all of Brother Huang's ledger

560
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,849
girl, i haven't seen asking for help

561
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,849
as fierce as you

562
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,849
i am not asking you, i am ordering you

563
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,599
If you don't write, I will

564
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,599
kill me?

565
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,349
that won't work if I kill you

566
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,599
the ledger will be destroyed

567
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,849
let it be destroyed then

568
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:03,849
how about that

569
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,599
This is countless people's painstaking effort

570
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,099
how many people died for it

571
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,099
My sister said to bring down those dogs

572
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,349
and rescue hundreds of people  from the disaster area

573
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:14,599
All rests on this account. Write it now!

574
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,099
You also know that this ledger is so important

575
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,099
Then why are you are not more polite to me

576
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:24,849
Polite to you, scum officer, am I polite to you?

577
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,849
for this ledger

578
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,599
It's all in this scum official's head

579
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:31,599
With you being so threatening

580
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:36,349
Can't remember, can't write

581
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,099
Can't save the disaster area

582
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:38,849
you dare

583
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:44,599
Then what do you want to write it?

584
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,099
Xiaoyue

585
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,099
how about we go out to eat

586
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,349
In your dreams

587
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,099
You see how nervous I am these days

588
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,849
Shocked and frightened, my stomach hasn't had anything

589
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,099
Brain is all confused

590
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:04,310
can't remember

591
00:43:04,656 --> 00:43:06,099
dogs officers are greedy

592
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:15,849
man

593
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,849
Sir, what do you have?

594
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,599
Make us a pot of good dragon tea

595
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,349
Okay

596
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:54,849
Lady Four you

597
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,599
How did Yongzheng treat his brother?

598
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,849
Let his son taste his own medicine tonight

599
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,849
you put in poison?

600
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,349
Sir, here is your tea

601
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:36,349
This tea is very good
